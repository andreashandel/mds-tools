You can mention specific skills in those documents, but you can’t really demonstrate them. This makes it difficult.\nEven if you are not looking for a new job, having your work and skills out there is a good way of having potential opportunities come your way. Say someone is looking for a speaker/presenter for an event who could talk about a particular topic. They might ask colleagues for recommendations, or search online. If you have work online that shows that you are proficient in that topic, you might be contacted.\nA more altruistic reason is that if you have knowledge in a certain area, sharing it publicly can potentially help others learn from you. Just think of the many times you looked for and found some useful information online. You can be the provider of such information too!",

Second, you need to write a bunch of commands in the programming language of your choice to get what you are hoping to accomplish. The first part is generally the intellectually more challenging one, and a step which AI (currently) are not very good at. The second part is generally less hard, but it can be very tedious, especially if you are new to coding or if you need to write a lot of code. AI are getting pretty good at helping with writing code.\nI expect that soon, instead of people writing code, most code will be written by AI under the guidance and direction of people. This should eventually lead to much more efficient, and potentially also better code. We aren’t quite there yet, but the current AI tools are already quite useful for helping with code tasks, so you should use them.",

    "text": "Good prompting\nTo get good results from the AI, it is important that you be as specific as you can with your prompt.\nTry this prompt with one of the LLM AI:\n\nWrite R code that generates a scatterplot and a violin plot.\n\nYour result might or might not be close to what you had in mind. If you are not providing a lot of details, the AI can decide what to do and sometimes it is close to what you had in mind, but often it is not.\nNow try this prompt:\n\nWrite R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals with ages from 18 to 49, BMI values from 15 to 40 and smoking status as yes or no. Assume that age and BMI are uncorrelated. Assume that smokers have a somewhat lower BMI. Then use the patchwork R package to generate a panel of ggplot2 plots. The first panel should show a violin plot with BMI on the y-axis and smoking status on the x-axis. The second panel should show a scatterplot with age on the y-axis and BMI on the x-axis. Add thorough documentation to your code.\n\nWhen I gave the second prompt to ChatGPT 3.5, it gave me this fully working code. It is possible that when you try this, the code will look slightly different. Remember, these AI tools are not fully deterministic and can produce different results each time. Hopefully, what you get will run. If not, you might need to either fix the code or ask the AI to fix it (we’ll look at that in another unit).\nAs you can see, good prompts are often quite long. It makes sense to write those down outside the AI first. That also helps somewhat with reproducibility. I generally try to stick AI prompts at the top of my R/Quarto files, or into a separate file.\nYou also notice that for the second prompt, I had to know more about the programming language, for instance I had to know that there is a package called ggplot2 and one called patchwork.\nYou will find that the more you know in general about a topic, the more useful those AI tools become. This means that you still have to learn some coding (or whatever the topic is) and understand it enough on a big picture level to be able to be useful. But you don’t necessarily need to be an expert.\nAn analogy I like is that of a composer. A composer needs to know enough about the various instruments of an orchestra to be able to write music for each instrument. But they don’t need to be able to play each instrument. Similarly, you need to know enough about coding or whatever the topic is you are working on to compose prompts for the AI and evaluate what it produces, but you don’t necessarily need to be an expert coder.",

    "section": "Iterating",
    "text": "Iterating\nIt’s rare that you get exactly what you want from the AI with your first prompt. Quite likely, you realize that you weren’t specific enough, or that you really wanted something slightly different but didn’t properly specify it in the prompt. Often, the code might also not quite work. The AI might have just made up a package or function that doesn’t exist, or otherwise introduced mistakes.\nWhile it would be nice to get a great product on the first try, the process is so fast that it doesn’t matter much. Just try again. You can either update your prompt and feed it to the AI again. Or you can tell it what changes you want to make. Try this as a starting prompt:\n\nWrite R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals, half of them female, with ages from 18 to 49, weight from 100 to 500 pounds and BMI from 15 to 35. Make a figure that shows weight on the x-axis, BMI on the y-axis, and stratification by sex. Add thorough documentation to the code.\n\nWhen I fed that to Bing in “precise” mode it produced this code. Note that it didn’t really give me an R script, I copied what it produced into an R file.\nThe code runs and produces a figure, but there are problems. Right now, the data is generated assuming each variable is independent of the other. We know that weight is strongly correlated with BMI, since it’s part of the equation defining BMI. We also know that males are generally heavier. We can easily fix this. One approach is to update your prompt and make it more explicit, such as:\n\nWrite R code that generates a dataset of 100 individuals, half of them female, with ages from 18 to 49, weight from 100 to 500 pounds and BMI from 15 to 35. Assume that males are generally somewhat heavier than females. Also assume that BMI and weight are positively correlated, based on the definition of BMI. Make a figure that shows weight on the x-axis, BMI on the y-axis, and stratification by sex. Add thorough documentation to the code.\n\nWith this updated prompt, I got this code, here are the relevant bits:\n\n# Generate a dataset of 100 individuals\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  # Generate sex variable with half of them female\n  sex = rep(c(\"male\", \"female\"), each = 50),\n  \n  # Generate ages from 18 to 49\n  age = sample(18:49, 100, replace = TRUE),\n  \n  # Generate weight values from 100 to 500 pounds\n  # Assume that males are generally somewhat heavier than females\n  weight = c(runif(50, min = 100, max = 400), runif(50, min = 200, max = 500)),\n  \n  # Generate BMI values from 15 to 35\n  # Assume that BMI and weight are positively correlated\n  bmi = c(runif(50, min = 15, max = 25), runif(50, min = 25, max = 35))\n)\n\nThere are several issues. It labeled the first 50 individuals as males, but assigned them the lighter instead of heavier weight. It also didn’t properly create BMI values as function of weight.\nWe could of course modify the prompt above further, trying again. Or we can directly iterate at the prompt and ask the AI to update the code. Here is an example:\n\nUpdate the code such that males and females are randomly distributed, make sure that males are on average heavier than females, and compute values for BMI as a function of weight with some random variation added.\n\nWith this prompt, I got this further updated code, here are again the relevant bits:\n\n# Generate a dataset of 100 individuals\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  # Generate sex variable with males and females randomly distributed\n  sex = sample(rep(c(\"male\", \"female\"), each = 50)),\n  \n  # Generate ages from 18 to 49\n  age = sample(18:49, 100, replace = TRUE),\n  \n  # Generate weight values from 100 to 500 pounds\n  # Make sure that males are on average heavier than females\n  weight = ifelse(sex == \"male\", runif(50, min = 300, max = 500), runif(50, min = 100, max = 300))\n)\n\n# Compute values for BMI as a function of weight with some random variation added\n# Assume a height of 1.75 meters for simplicity\n# BMI = weight(kg) / height(m)^2\n# Convert weight from pounds to kg (1 pound = 0.453592 kg)\ndata$bmi &lt;- (data$weight * 0.453592) / (1.75^2) + rnorm(100)\n\nThat looks better. However, when you try to run it, you’ll find that it doesn’t work. The problem is that it tries to use the variable sex before that data frame is defined. So we need to fix that code. We could of course do it by hand, but we can also see if we can get the AI to fix its own code. Which brings us to the next unit on using AI to fix code.",

    "section": "Neural networks (NN)",
    "text": "Neural networks (NN)\nCurrently, the main workhorse of artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of method/algorithm called a neural net/network (NN).\nThese are specific kinds of models that originated as an attempt to capture the functioning of biological neurons, and, by extension, brains. While neural nets have been around for a while and have had some successes (e.g. in digit recognition), they have really taken off in recent years with the advent of more data, faster computers, and better algorithms.\nWithout going into details, you can think of how neural nets work in a few ways. One is that they are collections of individual, in silico, neurons, which are combined into layers. On one end, the input is fed into the model, at the other end, the output is produced. See e.g. Wikipedia page on artificial neural networks for some schematic drawing. The input are your predictor variables, e.g. lots of characteristics measured for a patient; data from an -omics array; pixels of an image; words of some text; sounds of an audio file, etc. The output is whatever label you want to predict, e.g. for some images it could be the 4 categories cat/dog/neither/both. You feed the data to the model and train it. The training of a NN is conceptually similar to training other machine learning (ML) algorithms. Each neuron has parameters associated with it, and as you fit the model, these parameters are tweaked to optimize performance. The bigger your neural network (more neurons and more layers), the more flexible the model. This means it is potentially more powerful, but also more data-hungry.\nWhile the analogy to a biological brain is apt, this comparison does sometimes make NN sound more complicated and fancy than they are. To demystify NN somewhat, you can switch out the comparison to a biological brain, and instead think of them as a coupled set of logistic regressions. Each neuron is more or less described by some type of logistic regression function. It gets some input from multiple variables (either the original input, or a previous layer of neurons), and then based on that input and its parameter setting returns either 0/No or Yes/1. The output is then fed to the next layer of networks. The NN is thus a combination of individual logistic regression models, coupled together in some way.\nThis idea of connecting individual models to make a bigger, better model should be familiar by now. You saw it when we discussed making models like random forests that combine individual trees, and it was also mentioned as a general idea of ensemble models. You can think of NN as an ensemble of simpler, logistic-type models.\nOf course, neural networks are complicated. At this point, there are many different versions of NN in use, and understanding them in detail is time-consuming. However, as general user, you don’t need to understand all the details. Instead, like for other complex ML models, as long as you know how to use them and evaluate what they return, it is ok to not fully understand their inner workings. Properly training/fitting NN can be tricky, because they generally have many different parameters that need tuning to achieve good performance. Thus, a lot of development has gone into methods that allow for efficient tuning/fitting. Fortunately for us as users, these methods have become fairly good such that it is possible to use NN algorithms built by others and generally trust they work well – similar to us using other models (GLM, trees, SVM, etc.) – without having to worry about all the details.\nIf you want to learn more about neural nets, the Wikipedia entry is a good place to start. Also check the AI Resources page.",

These days, DL is sometimes used a bit more loosely and can refer to any NN-based complex algorithm (or sometimes even a non-NN complex model) applied to a problem.

Roughly speaking, AI is the use of complex models, usually NN, to solve difficult problems. If one wanted to differentiate DL and AI, one might say that AI is the use of DL approaches applied to “complex” problems. However, it seems these days that DL and AI are terms that are used largely interchangeably. Overall, if you hear AI or DL, you can think of it roughly as fitting a neural net model to data. Unfortunately, since DL and AI have become such hot topics, terms are often misused these days, especially outside academia.\nIf you want to learn a bit more on the distinction between DL and AI (and just in general), the AI and DL sections of Wikipedia are good starting points.\nAs with all “new and shiny” things, there seems to be a bit of a current trend to use DL/AI approaches even when not needed. As an example, DeVries et al. 2018 used deep learning to analyze data; this follow-up correspondence article from Mignan and Broccardo 2019 showed that a single logistic regression produced more or less the same results. The reply by one of the original authors, Meade 2019, is also worth reading.\nOverall, DL and AI are certainly very promising approaches and will undoubtedly lead to significant improvements in our ability to harness data. As with most technologies going through a “bubble” there is currently work that is both substantial and important, and work that is fluffy and full of hype.",

    "text": "DL and AI in R\n\nThis section is about using R to train/fit NN models, not how to use LLM AI tools like ChatGPT with R. That is covered in a separate unit.\n\nWhile R is a great tool for data analysis, it’s currently probably not the best choice for doing AI/fitting NN models. If you really want to go deep into AI work, using something like Python, Julia, or some more specialized programming language is likely better.\nThat said, there are some ways to use R to fit some NN models. The best and easiest way is likely to use R packages that allow you to interact with powerful tools such as TensorFlow and Keras through R.\nThe RStudio TensorFlow website has a lot of good information and documentation on how to use Keras through R to do DL/AI. Starting there with the Tutorials section is probably the best way to get going. After that you can branch out to some of the other resources. While I’m sure a DL/AI expert uses more than just Keras/Tensorflow as tools, you can get very far with those. And for playing around with DL/AI, Keras through R is a great place to start. See the exercise for suggested starting points.\n\nSince DL/AI usually involves fitting large amounts of data to complex models, time constraints are often crucial and, at times, powerful computers are needed. An important development is the use of GPU (graphical processing unit) computing. While modern computers usually have more than 1 CPU, they are still generally limited to a small number. Even a very powerful single desktop generally will have less than 100 CPUs. In contrast, modern graphics cards often have &gt;1000 GPUs that can all be used in parallel to perform model fitting. Products such as Tensorflow allow one to use (mainly NVIDIA) GPUs to fit complex models to a lot of data in an often reasonable amount of time without requiring a supercomputer cluster. Unfortunately, last time I tried, R still didn’t have great GPU support. I have not recently tried to use Keras with GPUs through R.",

Therefore, be careful with what you let the AI see. If you are re-analyzing publicly available data, you shouldn’t have to worry. But if the data is in any way confidential, it might not be a good idea to allow the AI to see it.\nThe best solution in that case is to generate synthetic data that looks like your real data, then ask the AI to write code to analyze this synthetic data. Once the AI gives you working code, you can take it off-line and apply it to your real data.\nSince synthetic (artificial/fake/simulated) data is very useful for many parts of the data analyis workflow, we will cover it in a separate unit.\nIn the following I’m assuming that you have data that can be shared with the AI.",

So I asked the AI to fix the code with this prompt:\n\nThis code does not work. It produces this error:\nError in augment.model_fit(lm_model) :\nargument “new_data” is missing, with no default\nPlease fix this and any other errors in the code.\n\nThe updated code looked like this. It fixed the first problem with augment(), but the resid() function returns NULL and something about the the specification for the logistic model is also not correct. Of course if I really wanted this to work, I’d ask the AI to keep fixing, and/or intervene manually. But for this example I don’t care that much if it works fully. The right bits seem to be there.\nInstead, I was curious if I can get it to produce some halfway reasonable code for a more complex model. Since this is longitudinal, time-series data, with multiple measurements per patient, a hierarchical approach would be better. Here is an attempt at having Claude write code for a hierarchical Bayesian model. Note that this model is still not a good one since it doesn’t really take into account the longitudinal structure, just the grouping within patients. But let’s try, with this prompt:\n\nWrite R code to analyze the data in the attached CSV file.\nUse the brms package to fit a hierarchical Bayesian linear model with drug concentration as predictor and cholesterol level as outcome, with patient as the grouping.\nFor each function call, use explicit notation to specify from which R package the function comes from.\nAdd thorough documentation to your code so it’s clear what each line of code does.\n\nHere is the code I got back. It looks promising, but again doesn’t quite work. Of course I could try to have Claude fix it or fix myself. But I don’t feel like it right now, I’ve got some more content to write 😁.

I’ll give Bing the code that generates the data, then ask it to fit models to that generated data. Here is the prompt:\n\nThe code below produces a data frame called syn_dat2. Take the data in that data frame and fit a linear model with drug concentration as predictor and cholesterol level as outcome.

Please fix it. Also, update it such that the actual R package from which a function comes from is called, not the tidymodels collection of packages.\n\nThe result was code that used the standard lm() and glm() functions. While ok, that’s not what I wanted, I still wanted tidymodels syntax, just not the tidymodels::function notation. So my next prompt was:\n\nChange the code above such that instead of using the lm() and glm() functions, it uses the tidymodels set of functions\n\nI ended up with this. It makes the same mistake as Claude, not properly turning the adverse event variable into a factor before trying to fit a logistic model. Some other bits also didn’t fully work, but I didn’t feel like fixing further.\nI think you get the idea. Basically, the AI can produce quite useful bits of code that can speed up things, but it’s rarely fully correct and you will always need to check it, and often at the end still manually intervene.

In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+OneDrive, etc. might be better.\nGitHub also has a problem with large files. Anything larger than around 20MB will slow down things, and files above 100MB usually lead to outright failure. Unfortunately, once you have a failed attempt to sync a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. Therefore keep large (&gt;50MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing them into the repository. Or place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive) and load them from there. You can also try Git Large File Storage (LFS), but that is more advanced and we will not cover it in this course.\nFinally, if you have data, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories (the GitHub name for your projects) are public and everyone can see them. You can set them private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. We’ll discuss this a bit more in a future unit.",

The difference to Dropbox & Co is that syncing between your local computer and github.com is not automatic. So do not forget to pull before you start work on a repository and push once you are done. (We’ll cover GitHub terminology and the meaning of push and pull shortly.)\nBecause GitHub works similar to other sync services, it is generally a bad idea to locally store your GitHub repositories in a folder that is synced by another service. If you do, sync processes mighg conflict, potentially leading to a syncing mess. For any GitHub repository, store it locally in a folder that is not synced across your computers by another software (such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Box, etc.)\nSimilarly, do not store a GitHub repository inside another repository. While this is technically allowed, it can easily lead to a mess. Each repository should be separate and not connected to any other syncing service.\n\nFrustration note: Git/GitHub can be finicky, even for seasoned users. If that happens, do not panic.

Once you have done that, you can put the anonymized data into a repository. If you want to be extra safe, you might want to opt for a private repository (see next section).

Note that private repositories are not free unless you have a GitHub Pro account (which is free for students via the GitHub Student Developer Pack). If you are working in an organization (e.g., your university or company), they might have a GitHub Enterprise account that allows for private repositories.\nYou can switch repositories from public to private and vice versa in the repository settings on GitHub.

    "text": "Keeping files local\nIt might be that you do need to work with data that cannot be anonymized and that you cannot or don’t want to put into a private repository. In that case, you should keep such data files outside of your Git repository. You can still use GitHub for your code and non-sensitive files, but keep the sensitive files on your local machine only. You can then load the sensitive data from your local machine when running your code. This way, the sensitive data never enters the Git repository.\nGit allows you to specify certain files and folders that are not being tracked, and thus not being pushed to your repository on GitHub.com. This is done via a special file called .gitignore placed in the root of your repository. You can add patterns to this file to exclude files or directories that contain sensitive information. For instance, if you have a raw data folder that you want to not track with Git/GitHub, you would place this into your .gitignore file:\ndata/raw/\nThis would exclude the entire raw folder inside the data folder from being tracked by Git. You can add as many patterns as you want to the .gitignore file.\nAn important drawback of this approach is that if you work on multiple machines, or work with collaborators, everyone needs to make sure to have the same sensitive files outside of the repository on their local machines. This can be a logistical challenge.\nA possible workaround is to place these files into another Sync service, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive that you consider to be safe. You can then load the files from there when running your code. This way, the sensitive files are not in the Git repository, but you can still share them with collaborators via the Sync service. (This approach also works well for large files that you can’t sync with Git/GitHub.)\n\nRemember that Git tracks the full project history. So if at any time you added a file with sensitive information, even if you delete it later, it’s still in the history and can be found. If that happens, you basically need to completely delete the GitHub repository (after copying all important files to a safe location) and starting over with a new repository, taking care to keep sensitive files out of this new repor.",

In simple terms, Quarto is piece of (powerful) software that can take various input sources (text, code, etc.) and process them to produce well-formatted output documents that are a seamless combination of text, figures, tables and other elements. Various output formats are available, including HTML, PDF, Word documents, presentations, and websites.\nQuarto is the successor of the R Markdown framework, which has been widely used for reproducible research and dynamic reporting in the R community.

    "section": "Why Quarto?",
    "text": "Why Quarto?\nTraditional methods of authoring scientific and technical documents often involve separate tools for analysis and presentation. For instance, code is written in some language such as R or Julia, then executed. The code produces output such as figures or tables, which might be copied into a Word document, or pasted into a PowerPoint presentation or onto a website. This separation of analysis and presentation is not efficient and creates challenges for reproducibility.\nThe idea for Quarto is that one can use one unified system that combines input, such as narrative text and executable code, with results such as figures and tables, and easily and automatically generates well-formatted output documents in the form of HTML, PDF, Word, and more. This can lead to a workflow that is much more automated, efficient and reproducible.",

The other option is to fully run scripts. This is the preferred way for any real project and coding work. We suggest you get used this way of executing code right away.\nWhat you just created is an R script, as compared to a function, which would have the word function at the start. More on that later. You can save the R script to a file with a .R extension, for instance test-script.R.\nOnce you’ve done that, go the the little triangle symbol in the upper left corner of the editor and pick ‘Source R File’. You should see stuff happening on the right sidebar of Positron. Some variables should show up and a plot appear in the Plots pane. Congratulations, you just ran your first R script inside Positron! In the Session pane, you can also see the command that was executed to run the script: source(\"path/to/your/script.R\"). As a general rule, anything you can do by pressing buttons inside Positron is also possible by typing commands into the R session console or the terminal.\nAs mentioned, you can also run code line by line. To do so, place your cursor into the line of code you want to run, and press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter. You should see the code execute in the R console on the right side. Try that with each of the three lines of code in your script. Note that you usually need to execute code in order. Try that. Go to the R console and hit that circle icon that says “Restart R”. This clears out the previously created x and y objects. Now go into the second line of your code y &lt;- x^2 and try to run it with Ctrl/Cmd + Enter. You should see an error message in the R console, because x does not exist yet. Go back to the first line and run it, then go back to the second line and run it again. This time it should work.\nInteractive execution of code is useful during exploration and development, but for any real project work, you should always run full scripts. That way, you ensure that everything is executed in the right order and that all dependencies are met. This also makes your project reproducible. You should get used to the approach of running your code with the source() command.",

As you do so, you should see the Problems tab go from No problems detected to a statement about what is wrong. Sometimes these statements are more informative, sometimes less.

You will also notice that the syntax highlighting of the code changed to show where the mistake is.\nLet’s for now ignore the warning. Save the file again and try to run it. You can run it again as before by clicking the triangle button. Or you can go into the R console, use the arrow up button to pull up the last command, which should be the source... statement, and hit enter to re-execute. You should see an error message appear in the console. You will also see a Show Traceback option. Click on it, and something maybe not too informative will show. What traceback means is it tries to figure yout where exactly the error happened. For a simple script like the one we are running, this doesn’t provide more information than the error message itself. But once you start writing more complex code, it is quite often the case that your script calls some function which calls another function,… And then it’s often tricky to figure out where the error occured and how it got triggered.

There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax (rules for how to write code), strengths and weaknesses, and areas of application. Some programming languages are general-purpose, meaning they can be used for a wide range of tasks (e.g., Python, Java, C++). Others are more specialized, designed for specific tasks or domains (e.g., R for statistics, SQL for database queries).\nFor data science type work, there are several popular programming languages, including R, Python, Julia, and MATLAB. Each of these languages has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use often depends on the specific needs of the project, the preferences of the team, and the existing ecosystem of tools and libraries.",

    "text": "R strengths and weaknesses\nLike every programming language, R has its advantages and disadvantages. Feel free to do a web search on that topic, and you will encounter tons of people with tons of opinions. Some of the features that are useful to us are:\n\nR is Open Source, FREE, and cross-platform.\nR is a “high-level” programming language, relatively easy to learn (compared to Fortran, C, etc.).\nR comes with many integrated functions.\nR is great for statistics, data analysis, and graphics.\nThe R Community is very dynamic, helpful and welcoming.\nThrough R packages, it is easy to get lots of state-of-the-art algorithms.\nDocumentation and help files for R are generally good.\n\nWhile we use R in this course, it is not the only option for modeling and data analysis. Maybe the most similar to R, and widely used, is Python, which is also free. There is also commercial software that can be used to analyze data (e.g., Matlab, Mathematica, Tableau, SAS, SPSS). Other more general programming languages can at times be suitable as well (e.g., C, Fortran, Perl, Java, Julia). Depending on your future needs or jobs, you might have to learn one or several of those additional languages. The good news is that even though those languages are all different, they all share general ways of thinking and structuring code. So once you understand a specific concept (e.g., variables, loops, branching statements or functions), it applies to all those languages. Thus, learning a new programming language is much easier once you already know one. And R is a good one to get started with.",

You can also give it code that doesn’t work or that you don’t understand and ask it to explain it to you.\nThe most challenging part about using AI tools for coding is learning how to ask the right question, and being able to assess what the AI returns.

You will also be specifying locations for saving and loading files that are relative to your main project folder, thus allowing someone else to reproduce your work, even if they have a copy of your project folder and subfolders in a different location on their computer.\nOrganizing work into projects is very important for reproducibility, efficiency, automation and collaboration.",

The folder with this file indicates the top level project folder, and everything inside this folder - including sub-folders - is part of the project.\nPositron does support .Rproj files. However, since Positron is designed to work with multiple programming languages, it also allows for other types of files to indicate the project folder. The naming convention in Positron-world is to call a project a workspace.\nA very common setup is where a project/workspace corresponds to a Git/GitHub repository (Git/GitHub are explained in our Brief Introduction to Git/GitHub course). In this case, the project folder is the folder that contains the .git folder (which is hidden by default). Everything inside this folder - including sub-folders - is part of the project.\nSimilarly, for a Quarto project, e.g. a Quarto-based website, if Positron finds a _quarto.yml file in a folder, it considers it the main folder of a project/workspace.\nSometimes, Positron adds a file into the workspace at .vscode/settings.json, but only if the user sets custom settings. The existence of such a file also indicates the top folder of a project/workspace.\nIf at least one of these files/folders are present, Positron recognizes it as a top folder of a project/workspace.",

If you know that you will be using Git/GitHub for the project (in general highly recommended), you can initialize it. Then open the new folder in Positron, and start working.

If you need to do use a computer on which you do not have admin rights, and your admin is not willing to install Positron, remember that you can do everything we discuss and teach using a different editor/IDE. You might not be able to exactly follow the instructions we provide, but you should be able to get everything working in pretty much any IDE.\nIf you have choices during install for Positron to do certain things (e.g. get an ‘Open with Positron’ option in Windows Explorer), we recommend you choose to have all of those options enabled.

You should basically approve all of them to ensure Positron will fully work.\nYou might run again into administrative issues. If you get requests from your computer to log in as admin, do so or have your admin help you through this part as well. Things might still work even without some of these permissions, but it is better to have it fully set up and allow Positron access to everything it needs.\nOnce all the initial start-up things are done, Positron is ready to go.

To see and manage them, open the Extensions view, by clicking the extension icon on the left sidebar in Positron (it looks like 4 squares, with the top right being tilted). You’ll then see a list of extensions.\nBy default, you see a list of installed extensions. If you just installed Positron, some extensions might need updating. Go ahead and update them. Some might need a restart of the extension (occasionally, you might have to fully restart Positron).\nExtensions can be turned on and off. Enabled extensions are shown normally. Those that are installed but disabled are grayed out. It’s generally safe to disable extensions you don’t need. Just click on the gear icon next to the extension name, then click on ‘Disable’. You can always re-enable it later.\nEnabling or disabling extensions can be helpful for specific situations. For instance there are various extensions that can give you access to AI support. It could be that you don’t want to use one of them for a while, since it is getting in the way of your coding or writing. You can then disable the extension by clicking on the gear icon, then on ‘Disable’ (you have to likely restart it). You can also disable extensions for specific projects (which Positron calls workspaces). Say you have some project with sensitive data where you don’t want AI to operate on. You can turn the AI off for that project/workspace.\nFinally, if you decide you don’t like an extension at all, just click on it completely uninstall it.",

First, click on ‘File’ -&gt; ‘Open File’ and open some CSV file on your computer. If you don’t have one readily available, ask your favorite AI to make you one, e.g. with a promt like “Generate a small, realistic dataset with 10 variables and 20 observations. Return the result as a downloadable CSV file.”\nThe file should open in the main window, and you should see a nicely formatted data frame. This formatting is courtesy of Positron, one of the many nice features of this IDE. But let’s say we don’t want to have it pre-formmatted by Positron. Click on the ‘Open as plain text file’ button on the top. This should open the CSV file as simple text, you’ll see entries separated by commas. That’s ok, but a bit hard to read. So let’s improve this with an extension.\nGo to the Extensions sidebar and search for ‘Rainbow CSV’. Click on the ‘Install’ button (trust the publisher). Now go back to your open CSV file. You should now see each column in a different color, courtesy of this new extension. This makes CSV files easier to read.\nThis was a very basic extension. Given that Positron already nicely formats CSV files, you might not need the extension. But there are several ones you might want in the future, based on your specific needs.\nRecall that Positron is based on VS Code. To learn a bit more about Positron extensions, and how they do and don’t differ from VS Code extensions, check out the Positron extensions page on the Positron documentation website.",

If you want to change it globally, select the User tab at the top of the settings window.",

You can search for specific commands and change their shortcuts by clicking the pencil icon next to them.\nFor instance, in Positron, to quickly turn code into comments (by adding a # in front of it for R cde), the default is to select the code chunk you want to comment out and then press the Ctrl/Cmd + / keyboard shortcut. This differs from RStudio, where it is the Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + C shortcut. If you prefer the RStudio shortcut, you can change it in Positron.",

You can change almost anything, from the layout of the editor to how it behaves when you run code. You want to make sure to explore the settings a bit and find what works best for you, but not waste too much time trying out every possible setting.\nIn general, if you find yourself thinking “I wish I could change Positron to do/show X”, there’s probably a way to do so. If it’s not built into Positron, you might find the needed functionality in an extension, which is discussed in a separate unit.\nAnd again remember, while Positron is fairly new, it’s based on VS Code which has been around for a while and is widely used. So if you are trying to figure out to customize something, it’s probably better to search for “How do I do X in VS Code” instead of “How do I do X in Positron”. Many of the same principles and settings apply.",

It gives you access to different views related to Positron and your editor. Whatever you click on will open to the right of the Activity Bar in an area called Primary Side Bar. You’ve already encountered the Extensions view.\nThe first icon on the activitiy bar, which looks like several sheets of paper, opens a view you likely use a lot, namely the file explorer view. You can use it to quickly open files and create new ones. The search view is also a handy tool to find things quickly and do search and replace operations.

    "text": "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nAny kind of data analysis and modeling project generally requires interacting with data, writing and debugging code, managing files, producing figures and tables, generating manuscripts or reports, and more. It is convenient to do all this through a single interface, at least as much as possible. This is where the concept of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) comes in. It is a piece of software that not only lets you write code, but also allows you to do many other project functions through a single interface.\nAnother way to think of IDEs is that they are code editors with a lot of additional bells and whistles. The idea is that one has all the functionality one needs to not just write code, but also to run it and debug it, to look at results, to manage files, etc. in a single place. That’s what an IDE tries to do.\nMost IDEs share certain features:\n\nThe editor is where you write your code. It usually offers syntax highlighting, intelligent completion, and many other features that make coding life easier.\nThe console/terminal area (called panel in Positron) is where you can interact with other pieces of software, such as programming languages (e.g. R, Python, Julia), where you see error messages, and where you can debug.\nAn area (it is the left side bar for Positron) where you can interact with files, perform version control with GitHub, manage extensions, and other operations.\nAnother area (usually the right side bar in Positron) that shows outputs such as figures, allows you to interactively explore data and objects generated by your code, and provides further functionality.\n\nHaving all these features inside one platform makes modern IDEs rather powerful. The flip-side is that it takes time getting used to all the functionality. But it’s generally worth the effort since IDEs make coding and related project work much more efficient. Most IDEs are highly configurable, so you can arrange the items you want to see and where to see them. We’ll discuss that a bit more shortly.",

    "text": "The Positron IDE\nSome IDEs focus on a specific programming language (e.g., RStudio), others are very language-agnostic (e.g., VS Code). Positron is a bit in the middle. It’s a fairly new IDE developed by the folks from Posit, who previously developed RStudio. The idea is that it’s an IDE that has strong integration for certain programming languages – currently the main focus is on R and Phython – while also allowing you to work with other languages, such as Julia.\nPositron is cross-platform and free. Because it’s from the same folks that created Quarto, it plays nicely with it. It has many of the nice, user-friendy features of RStudio, but has been designed to be more flexible, extensible and supporting more languages compared to RStudio.\nPositron is a spin-off of VS Code, which is a very popular IDE developed by Microsoft. Positron builds on top of VS Code and adds a lot of functionality that is specifically useful for data analysis and modeling projects. Because of this, Positron also supports a wide range of extensions (add-ons) that can further enhance its functionality. We’ll discuss extensions in more detail in a later unit.",

If you don’t have it on your computer, you should still read this section, you just can’t run it for now.\n\nPositron is meant for working with code. It is especically designed to work well with R and Python, but other languages are also supported, many through extensions. Let’s explore a small example with R. Go to “File” -&gt; “New File” and pick “R File”. An empty file will open in the editor. Write a few lines of R code, for instance the following\n\nx = seq(1,100)\ny = x^2\nplot(x,y)\n\nNext, save the file somewhere. If Positron was ‘just an editor’, we would now have to switch over to R and run the code there. But with an IDE, we can do it all in one place. You should see a small triangle symbol in the top right corner of the editor. Press it to run the code. This will open the R console in the bottom window, execute the ‘source’ command to run the code, and show the resulting plot in the bottom right window. In the top right window, you can also see the variables that were generated.\nLet’s say you want to have a line instead of circles for the plot but don’t remember the command. In the R console, you can type ?plot to call the help file for the plot function, which will show in a separate pane.\nOnce you found what you are looking for, change your code so it says plot(x,y,type='l') and run again. This time, instead of pressing the ‘run’ button, try to execute the code one line at a time. You can do that by starting in the first line and pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter. The first line will be executed, and you can then continue to the next line by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter again. You will see the new plot show up. You should also see that the old plot is still there, you can go back to it with the arrows above the plot. The menu above the plot also allows you to save any of them, and do other things.\nIt is generally not advised to do any steps like writing code or saving plots manually, you should instead have fully automated code do all of it to ensure reproducibility. But for exploring and testing, these iterative and manual steps are often needed and having all these features in one location makes some of these coding, modeling and data science talks much more efficient.",

Finally, safe the file as .qmd file.\nThen press the ‘preview’ button above the editor window. Quarto should run and compile/render the document.

You will learn more R as we go along, but the focus of the class is on data analysis, so while I will provide you with resources to figure out the R bits, outside of this module we will not focus on ‘learning R’. You will learn by doing as we go through the course. As with anything, the more you practice, the better you will get. You should approach learning to code with an attitude of fearless curiosity. You will get stuck, you will get frustrated with some weird error message in your code (still happens to me at least once a week), and you will eventually figure it out. Make use of the great resources that are out there.\nThis figure illustrates the journey of learning to write code:\n\n\n\nThe journey of learning to code. Source: https://www.thinkful.com/blog/. Original post is not online anymore.\n\n\nMy goal is that during this course, you will reach the beginning of the upswing of awesome, at least when it comes to being able to use R to perform data analyses. But to get there, you’ll have to go over the cliff of confusion and through the desert of despair, and I’m confident that you’ll get there and won’t be stuck in the hand-holding honeymoon. In fact, at times I’m providing you less detailed instructions than I could to get you quickly to the stage where you have to figure out bits yourself. I guess one could say that instead of hand-holding, I let you stumble and fall some, and then will help you to get back up 😃. It might feel a bit more frustrating at least initially, but it’s a much better way to learn.\nIt goes without saying that learning to code (or learning anything else) is not a linear process.

At this point, most of the time, you will likely get the best initial help from some AI tool. We recommend to start there, and if that doesn’t solve your problem, then move on to other sources.\n\n\n\nFortunately rare for R. Source: xkcd.com.\n\n\nIn those rare cases when AI doesn’t help and you cannot find the right information online either to solve your coding problem, feel free to ask for help. Sometimes, people complain that replies to questions they ask online are unfriendly or harsh. While this is at times true, consider that all the people providing answers are volunteers. They’re doing it because they want to help others, they don’t get paid for it. It is therefore important that the person asking the question does not waste people’s time by asking poorly formulated questions or questions that have been previously answered. In general, those kinds of questions get rude replies. If you have done your homework (i.e., searched online first to see if the answer is already available) and can precisely formulate the question/problem, ideally with a reproducible example, the chance that you get an unfriendly reply is very low.\nI have found that a good way of posing question is to write something like this: “I need help with SPECIFIC PROBLEM, I have searched around and found LINKS/DESCRIPTION OF SIMILAR ISSUES but that doesn’t quite solve my problem yet.” If you have a coding problem, add “Here is some code illustrating what I want to achieve and where the problem is.” and then add a minimal reproducible example.\nThe more you show you’ve done your homework and are truly stuck (instead of just being lazy and wanting others to do the work for you), and the easier you make it for others to understand what your problem is, the more likely you will get good answers.",

    "text": "Some further comments\nR has a bunch of quirks. You’ll likely encounter a number of them. Here are a few common ones.\nA common confusion is that there are two ways of assigning something to an object. One can write x &lt;- 2 or x = 2 and often (but not always) you can use either. People argue about which way to do it. You’ll see both versions used frequently. If you are completely new to programming, we recommend the first version, i.e. x &lt;- 2. The problem is that most other programming languages do it the second way, so if you learned to code in another language first, it is more natural to write x = 2. It is your choice. Just be aware that both notations exist. And to add to the confusion: In R, you can also write this in the opposite direction, i.e. 2 -&gt; x. This is unususal coding style and best avoided. Just know that it exists too.\nA more recent confusion - since the concept was introduced to R more recently - is the pipe. You can write x %&gt;% dplyr() or you can write x |&gt; dplyr(). In both versions, the object x is piped into the dplyr function. You see this style of writing a lot in the tidyverse and tidymodels set of packages, which we’ll discuss shortly. Both versions usually do the same thing. The first version comes from the magrittr package, which is part of the tidyverse. The second version is part of base R. Fortunately, most of the time it doesn’t matter. However, occasionally one will not work (or produce something unexpected). Just be aware of this and adjust as needed.\nAs you continue on your coding journey, keep in mind: The great thing about programming is that you (usually) can’t really “break” things too much. In the worst case you get an error message. So experiment and try out anything you like!",

Of course, you are free to install and use any package you come across for any of the assignments.\nThe “official” place for packages is the CRAN website. To install a package from CRAN, go to the R console prompt (the &gt; symbol) inside the R session console and type install.packages(\"PACKAGENAME\"). Often, a package needs other packages to work (called dependencies), and they are installed automatically. It usually doesn’t matter if you use a single or double quotation mark around the name of the package. Note that R cares about capitalization, so you need to get the upper and lower case exactly right. Otherwise, it won’t work.\nTry installing a package yourself. Open a workspace/project in Positron. Then go to the R prompt (the &gt; symbol) and type\n\ninstall.packages('DSAIRM')\n\nThis installs a package that gives you access to various infectious disease within-host simulation/QSP models.

If you want to learn more, take a look at the package website.\nIf this is the first time you are installing packages, you’ll see that a lot of other packages are installed, too. You might get a message about Installing from source packages that need compilation. You should generally say No to this. If you are on a Windows computer, compilation requires you to have Rtools installed. It’s not a bad idea to install Rtools (if you do, make sure you pick the version that matches your R version.) But even then, or if you use a Mac or Linux (which have the equivalent of Rtools already pre-installed) sometimes the compilation doesn’t work. So if you have a choice, say No. (On some Mac/Linux setups, things happen automatically, then just let it run.)\nTo see which packages are needed by a specific package, e.g. DSAIRM, and thus are being installed if not present, type tools::package_dependencies(\"DSAIRM\") into the R console. Of course it can be that those packages depend on other packages, so you end up installing even more. At some point, you’ll have the most common packages all installed and installing new packages will lead to less overall installing. The package install process generally works well.\nIt is very common these days for packages to be developed on GitHub. It is possible to install packages from Github directly. Those usually contain the latest version of the package, with features that might not be available yet on the CRAN website. Sometimes, in early development stages, a package is only on Github until the developer(s) feel it’s good enough for CRAN submission. So installing from Github gives you the latest. The downside is that packages under development can often be buggy and not working right. To install packages from Github, you need to install the remotes package and then use the install_github function. You don’t need to do that now, but will be asked to do it in the exercise.\nYou only need to install a package once, unless you upgrade/re-install R. Once installed, you still need to load the package before you can use it. That has to happen every time you start a new R session. You do that using the library() command (an alternative is require() but library() is recommend ). For instance to load the package you just installed, type\n\nlibrary('DSAIRM')\n\nYou should see a short message on the screen. Some packages show messages when you load them, and others don’t. In this case, the package tells you how to start it. Try it briefly, by typing the code below into the R console\n\ndsairmmenu()\n\nHopefully, a menu should open either inside Positron or an external browser. If the former happens, you can open it in your browser by clicking the pop-out symbol in the upper right corner that says “Open the current URL in the default browser”. You can use this R package to explore different infectious disease models/apps. Explore for as long or as short as you like, then exit the app. You will have to go back to the R console to see a goodbye message from the package.\nAnd this concludes our very quick introduction to R packages. You’ll use a lot of them, so you’ll get used to them rather quickly.",

The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share common design philosophies and are designed to work together seamlessly. If you want to learn more about the principles of those packages, you can read this short manifesto written by Hadley Wickham. Some of what he writes might not be fully understandable to you (e.g., functional programming or pipes), but you should get the overall idea. For our purpose, the important aspects to remember is that the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that are all structured similarly (from a user perspective). They play nice with each other, and help you in your various analysis tasks as you go from messy data to data that is tidied up and ready for formal analysis. In general, packages inside tidyverse focus on data cleaning, processing and visualization.\nTo install all the core packages of the tidyverse, you can use the command install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). We don’t recommend doing this!. The reason we dislike it is that you are automatically installing a lot of packages that you might never use. Instead, we recommend installing only the specific tidyverse packages that you need. This also makes it clearer to you which functionality comes from which package. Keeping package use to a minimum also reduces the chance of package conflicts and improves reproducibility.",

    "text": "tidyverse concepts\nAs you’ll find out shortly, one feature of R code written in the tidyverse style is the heavy use of the pipe operator. The original pipe operator, the %&gt;% symbol, was introduced in the magrittr package. Since then, base R got its own pipe operator, which is the symbol |&gt;.\nFor instance, this is the kind of code that you might see when doing data wrangling (note that this code doesn’t work since it only shows the chain of functions, for it to work there would need to be arguments provided to each function, i.e. there needs to be something inside the ()):\n\ndata %&gt;% filter() %&gt;% \n         select() %&gt;%\n         fct_lump() %&gt;%\n         mutate() %&gt;% ...\n\nThe idea is that you pipe the results from one operation into the next, and thus potentially build a long chain of commands. That style of coding makes it often quite easy to understand what the code is doing. For instance in the example code above, you first filter the data based on some row values, then select some columns, then combine some factor variable, then mutate a variable into a new one, and so on.\nThe problem, especially when you start out, is that things can (and will) go wrong at some of those steps, and it’s difficulty to figure out where the problem is. At least when starting out, it is in my opinion often better to save the result of some cleaning operation as a new intermediate variable. That lets you more easily check for bugs, and to see how the data changed from step to step and if it does what you think it should. So instead of using a long chain of pipes, you can write the code like so:\n\ndat_small1 &lt;- data %&gt;% filter()\ndat_small2 &lt;- dat_small1 %&gt;% select()\ndat_small3 &lt;- dat_small2 %&gt;% fct_lump()\n...\n\nThis code is not quite as easy to read, and it creates all these additional variables that you might not want or need. But at least as you are learning the different tidyverse functions, it often helps to be able to inspect what happens at each step, and thus more easily spot when things go wrong. Once you get more comfortable with cleaning steps and coding in general, and make few mistakes, you can start chaining things together, and make your chains longer. But if you start out writing code that way, it can be harder to follow along and find bugs.\nThere is a nice project called Tidy Data Tutor that allows you to visualize the different steps in a data analysis chain of commands. Once you get used to chaining commands together in a long pipeline, or try to inspect someone else’s code, using that tool to look at each step can be quite useful.",

You can add all kinds of additional information to a YAML. That information controls various aspects of the document rendering and appearance.\n\nOutput Formats\nThe starting point or input for Quarto is always one or multiple Quarto documents (.qmd files). From these source files, Quarto can generate output in various formats, including HTML, PDF, Word, and more.\nFor instance, if you want to create a Word document instead of HTML output for the example above, you would change the YAML from format: html to format: docx. Try doing that and re-rendering the document. You should now get a Word document as output instead of an HTML file. You should be able to find the word document in the same folder where your Quarto document is located. If fully configured, Positron might also give you the option to open the Word document.\nSimilarly, if you want to create a PDF document, you would change the YAML to format: pdf. Note that creating PDF documents requires a LaTeX installation on your computer. If you don’t have LaTeX installed, Quarto will give you an error when you try to render to PDF.

The process of cloning creates a local copy of the repository on your computer. You also use that approach if you are collaborating with someone on a repository that they created.\nThe important terminology here is that cloning means copying a repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Once that happens, in the future to get updates from GitHub.com to your local machine, you pull those changes. (Sometimes, you might also see the word fetch, which is similar to pull, but does not automatically merge changes into your local files. For simplicity, we will mainly just use pull here since you usually want to merge anything from the online repository with your local version of that repo.)",

Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository (click the + icon at the top right and select New repository). Give it a name, e.g., my-test-repo. Give it a short description, turn on ‘add README’, keep visibility to public, and keep the rest of the settings as they are. Then click Create repository.\nThis has now created a new public repository on Github.com. At the moment, it is mostly empty apart from the README.md file we told it to create.\n\n\nClone the repository\nNow that we have a repository on GitHub.com, we can clone it to our local machine. Open GitHub Desktop. In the menu, click on File &gt; Clone repository…. In the dialog that opens, select the my-test-repo repository you just created (it should show up under the GitHub.com tab). Select a local path where you want to clone it to, and click Clone. _Remember that you don’t want to place the local copy in a location that is synced by other tools such as OneDrive or Google Drive.\nOnce you have the repository on your local machine, open the folder in Positron. Since this is a GitHub repository, Positron will recognize it as a project/workspace.\nOpen the README.md file in the Positron editor, and change the text, then save it.\n\n\nCommitting and pushing changes\nNow go back to GitHub Desktop. You should see that it detected the change you made to the README.md file. You can now stage and commit that change. In GitHub Desktop, enter a short commit message, e.g., “Update README”, and click Commit to main. You can leave the ‘Description’ field empty. Once you committed, you are ready to push your changes to GitHub.com. The online location is referred to as origin. Click the Push origin button to push your changes. To verify that the changes are online, go back to GitHub.com and refresh the page for your repository. You should see that the README.md file has been updated and there should be your commit with its title. As you keep working on the project, you can repeat this process of editing files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.com. If others make changes, or you work on multiple computers, you will need to make sure before you start working that you pull any changes from GitHub.com to your local machine.\nThese commits that will accumulate as you work on the project will create a history of changes that you can always go back to if needed. So if you did something a few weeks ago, then changed your code and now realized you need the old version back, you can click on that commit in GitHub Desktop and restore the files to that version. You can then pull out the changes you need from that version.",

A conflict happens if two people change the same file. GitHub will try to merge changes automatically, but if it can’t, you’ll need to resolve the conflict manually. Sooner or later, you will encounter such merge conflicts. They can be agravating at first, but you’ll soon learn how to deal with them. The best approach is to avoid them as much as possible.",

The idea is that you should think of LLM AI tools as being good at tasks that an intern, or a new graduate could do without too much training. For example, asking ChatGPT to solve world hunger is not a good idea. However, asking it to give you a list of countries where malnutrition is the worst and a summary of likely reasons for that, is a task where it will probably produce a result that you can use as starting point for whatever your larger project is.\nWhat that means is that to get the most out of the AI, you should break your tasks into manageable, well-prescribed bits, and ask the AI to tackle each one.

You can throw ideas at the AI that are more open-ended, and ask it to provide its thoughts. Then you can iterate and that way possibly explore a topic and various options much faster than if you just thought about it yourself. This doesn’t always lead to good results, but it’s so quick and easy, it’s often worth a try. Note that if you use AI in this way, you would interact with it differently compared to the above approach. To get specific work done, e.g. getting the AI to write you a piece of code, you want to be as specific and detailed as possible. You will often provide very long prompts. In contrast, if you use AI as brainstorming partner, you can have shorter, more vague prompts and do more of a back and forth.

We use electricity all the time, and we rarely think about it. My guess is that AI will become that way. It will be interesting to watch how we get there. In the early days of electricity, there were fights about AC versus DC and lots of things were tried that didn’t work and it took a while before we had a (kinda) functioning electric grid that mostly just works.

In fact, I asked the LLM (Bing AI in creative mode) to give me its thoughts on this analogy with this prompt:\n\nWrite a half-page paragraph that compares an LLM AI user to a composer or conductor, and the LLM AI tool to an orchestra.\n\nThe returned paragraph was pretty weak and not what I had in mind (try yourself, maybe you get something better). Here is my thought: The AI is a very versatile tool and you can do a lot of things with it, kinda like an orchestra. As a composer or conductor, you don’t need to be able to play each instrument of the orchestra. But you do need to know enough about each instrument to compose meaningful instructions as to what everyone should play, and you should know what to expect, so when you tell the trumpets to play a certain tune, you should be able to assess if what they produce is what you have in mind, and correct as needed.\nOf course, this analogy goes beyond AI tools. We can say the same about other complex tools, for instance the R programming language or a car. You don’t need to understand all the details of how these complex systems work under the hood (unless you want to become a full-time programmer or car mechanic), but you do need to know enough to give useful instructions, use them effectively, and critically assess what the machine returns and correct as needed.",

    "text": "Introduction\nThis topic is very similar to the approach for writing code. In that unit, we already discussed how to iteratively update and improve the code. Fixing non-working code is really just another version of asking the AI iteratively to improve things. However, it seemed distinct enough to me that I thought it’s worth placing it into a separate unit.\nThe assumption is that you have some code (likely AI generated, but could also be code you wrote) and need to fix some typos. If the code was generated in the current session, you can just refer to it in your prompt. If the code was generated previously, you will supply the code as part of the prompt. The latter approach is more general, so I’m focusing on that one.",

    "text": "Fixing through iteration\nThe most basic approach is to just feed the AI non-working code and tell it to fix it. Here is an example continued from the non-working code we had at the end of the AI and code writing unit. To mimic a general setting, with code possibly produced earlier or not by the AI, I started a new session with the Bing AI in ‘precise’ mode and gave it this prompt.\n\nThis code does not work. Please fix it.\nPASTE ALL CODE FROM THIS FILE HERE.\n\nHere is what I got back:\n\nI see that you’re trying to generate a scatter plot of BMI against weight, stratified by sex. The code you’ve provided seems to be correct. However, the issue might be due to the specific versions of the ggplot2 and dplyr libraries you’re using, or it could be a problem with your R environment.\nIf you’re getting a specific error message, could you please provide it? That would help me understand the issue better and provide a more accurate solution. If you’re not seeing an error message, could you please describe what’s happening when you say the code doesn’t work? For example, is the plot not displaying as expected, or are the calculations not producing the right results? This additional information will help me assist you more effectively.\n\nSo this didn’t work. What’s next? One option is to see if another LLM AI can do it. For instance I could try and switch to another mode in Bing (creative or balanced) or try another LLM. I’m not doing this for now, but it might at times be worth giving it a try. What I’ll do here is to help the AI (as it suggested) by being more specific about the problem. Here is my updated prompt:\n\nThe code below produces this error message:\nError in eval(ei, envir) : object ‘sex’ not found\nPlease fix it.\nPASTE ALL CODE FROM THIS FILE HERE.\n\nWith this prompt, I got it to work. The AI gave me this helpful explanation and fully working code\n\nThe error message you’re seeing is due to the sex variable not being recognized within the ifelse function in your data.frame creation. This is because the sex variable is not yet defined at the time ifelse is called.\nYou can fix this by first creating the sex variable and then using it in the ifelse function. Here’s the corrected code:\nCODE IS HERE\n\nThe end result is still not perfect, the difference in weight by sex is too large and we might want more scatter. But that can easily be fixed with either further iterations of asking the AI to update the code, or manual interventions. Speaking of manual interventions…",

    "section": "Manual intervention",
    "text": "Manual intervention\nThe overall goal is to get working code as quickly as possible, not to have things completely AI generated. Therefore, if you reach a stage where you realize it’s faster if you just fix the code yourself, go ahead and do so.\nThis occurs at two stages. The most obvious one is close to the end. If the AI has given you code that is very close to what you want, but has a few issues (either conceptual or coding errors) that you immediately know how to correct, then just go ahead and finish things off manually. At this point, you should be able to “turn off” the AI and have working code that you can apply to your project.\nAnother situation you might want to intervene manually is if the AI gets stuck. For instance, if you have to keep asking the AI to fix/update some code and it still doesn’t produce what you want, you could go ahead and make some manual adjustments to the code that you know should happen, and then feed the code, which still may not be fully working, back to the AI and ask it to update further.\nThe nature of the AI algorithms is that they can “get stuck” and if you give them a slight change of scenery, they might be able to get unstuck and get you closer to your goal.",

    "section": "Shortcomings and Dangers of AI Tools",
    "text": "Shortcomings and Dangers of AI Tools\nFor all its promises, AI is not without its problems. It still has many shortcomings and dangers. Here, I’ll discuss some of the most important ones.\nI’m focusing here on the issues most relevant for our purposes. Broader, more tricky topics such as biases are real but I think not too relevant for using AI tools to help with data analysis and coding.\n\nPrivacy/Confidentiality\nWhen you use AI to help with data analysis, you might want to show your data to the AI and ask it to do something with it. The problem is that pretty much all these systems take your data and move it to the servers of whichever company you use for processing. Often, these companies keep your data to help improve their models. If you have data which is sensitive, e.g. human data, or data that you don’t want to share, then you need to be careful not to let the AI have access to the data. A good solution is to generate synthetic data that has the structure of your real data but is made up. Then you can ask the AI to process this synthetic data and give you the code it generated. In a later step, you can go “offline” and use the code the AI helped you write on your real data. We’ll discuss how to generate synthetic/artificial data shortly.\nBeyond the data, it is important to keep in mind that if you have the AI running (e.g., through the R Studio CoPilot integration), it might access not just your current file but possibly also other sources you link to, e.g. other stuff on your computer. If you have things you don’t want the company to “grab” and copy to their servers, then be careful about what you let the AI access.\nIn general, be careful what information you let the AI access and be aware that it might end up on the server of whatever company is running the AI tool.\n\n\nNon-working code\nWhile most of the AI tools have become pretty good at coding in R and other languages, at times they don’t get it right. You might get code back that doesn’t work. AI are known to hallucinate, i.e., make up stuff. For instance it’s not uncommon that the AI invents an R command that does not exist. So when you get your code back, you will often need to do some trouble-shooting. At times, you can tell the AI that the code is not correct and ask it to fix it. If this doesn’t always work, then you can make the fixes by hand or try to reformulate your request.\n\n\nReproducibility\nThe companies making AI tools constantly update and improve the algorithms. Further, the underlying methods often have random components. This means that if you give the same instructions to an AI tool on different occasions, the results/code you get might differ. This means things might be non-reproducible.\nWhile I encourage you to keep track of any input prompts you use to have the AI generate code, note that providing those prompts does not allow someone else (or future you) to exactly reproduce things. Thus, while AI tools can be useful helpers during the data analysis process, they should not be considered part of the final workflow, which instead should contain results/code (possibly generated with AI help) which can run in such a way to allow full reproducibility.\n\n\nEthics of using AI\nHere I’m not talking about the fact that most AI tools were trained on data without the permission of the original data generators, or that a lot of AI algorithms produce biased (unethical?) output. Those topics are too complex to tackle here. Instead, I’m talking about the ethics of using AI to help with your data analysis, or more generally your academic/professional work.\nSince these tools are so new, nobody knows yet how to properly acknowledge AI help. I’m not sure either. If I search Google for an example to help with my code, and find something on StackOverflow that I use as basis for my code, should I cite it? I sometimes do add a link to the original post in my code. Partly to give credit, and partly to remind myself where I got it from. But I don’t think there are clear rules on this.\nSimilarly, if you copy text from Wikipedia or some other source, you need to cite it. But if you read it, then repeat in your own words, when do you need to cite it? I don’t think it’s clear. This is similar with AI. If you have a full code or large chunk of text generated by AI and you use it “as is”, you probably need to state that. But it’s more likely that the AI will give you some parts of the code or text, and you write the rest. What is the rule for that? I don’t think there are clear rules.\nI suggest you follow the guideline of “if in doubt, cite/acknowledge”. For instance, at the beginning of some code, you can make a statement saying “part of this code was generated by ChatPGT using the following prompt” and then state the prompt you use. Or if you use AI to help you interpret your data, you can state somewhere in your output (e.g., your Quarto document), that you used AI to help generate insights/text/etc. Providing this kind of information prevents you from being accused of “cheating” (if someone thinks using AI is cheating, for this course, you are encouraged to do so), and it also helps somewhat with the reproducibility (see above).",

    "text": "Tips for best practices\nHere are some suggestions on how to use the AI tools as efficiently as possible.\n\nThink carefully about what exactly you want to the AI to accomplish and provide instructions that are as detailed and specific as possible. These days, this is often called prompt engineering.\nIterate. Often the first version you get from the AI will not exactly what you want. You can try to ask the AI to rewrite/change/fix things. Or you can manually edit the code, which you can then use as input to ask the AI to make further changes.\nTry different engines. E.g., ChatGPT doesn’t give you something useful, try Bing (which is also currently powered by ChatGPT, but gives somewhat different results).\nAsk the AI to add a lot of comments into the code to explain what each line of code does.\nBreak down big tasks into smaller tasks. Ask the AI to solve these smaller tasks individually and then pull things together.\nCite as appropriate. If in doubt, include more information (e.g., prompts).",

If you prefer to code in VS Code, you can install the Copilot plugin).\nTo get Copilot working in R Studio, follow these instructions. You might want to leave Copilot indexing unchecked for now. The instruction guide explains what this is. Basically, if you check this, copilot can access all files that are part of your current project. This can lead to confidentiality issues. Therefore, only check it if you are sure that all files in your project are ok being shared with the AI (and possibly make their way to Github/Microsoft/OpenAI servers).\nOnce you have Copilot up and running, you should see it show up in the bottom of your R Studio input window (the top right window where you write code). It will start suggesting things as you type, once you stop for a few seconds. You can set that time in the options.\nAn introduction to using Copilot can be found in this video by Thomas Mock from Posit/RStudio. In general, if you want bigger chunks of code, it seems currently better to go straight to ChatGPT. Copilot seems most useful to help you write bits of code as you go along. It can also be useful to help you remember the names of functions and arguments. This blog post provides some additional useful information on how to best use Copilot.\nIn general, I recommend you turn off Copilot in RStudio when you are not actively using it.

I expect further tools to keep coming out at a fairly rapid pace.\nFor instance, as you learned from Thomas Mock’s video above, the chattr R package seems like another great way to use ChatGPT from within R. Unfortunately, as of this writing, I haven’t been able to get it to work.

Go to the Online Portfolio Template. Make sure you are logged into GitHub, then click Use this template.\nCreate a new repository called yourname-portfolio (include both first and last name, e.g., andreashandel-portfolio). Choose a public repository.\nNext, clone the repository to your local computer (using e.g. GitHub Desktop). We recommend organizing your local repository folders in some way that works well for you. It’s generally a bad idea to place repository folders into a local folder that is synced with some other service (e.g., Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive.)\n\nQuick local website check\nOpen the repository as a project. Then open the main index.qmd file. You should see the Preview button in the upper left corner of the editor. Click it to render the website. You should see in the terminal window what Quarto is doing. It is not only rendering the current open .qmd file, but instead all files that are part of this project - which is a Quarto website.\nYou will likely get an error message during rendering, telling you about missing R packages. Install those packages as needed. Once rendering works without errors and is complete, you should see the website preview in the Viewer pane, or your browser (depending on your settings). If it is in the Viewer pane and you want to see it in your browser, click the Open in Browser button (the box with an arrow pointing out of it, in the upper right of the Viewer pane).\nIf you get missing package errors, install them and try again. A local preview should open in your browser.\n\nIf you cannot see the Build tab, open the Terminal and run quarto render to build the site.\n\n\n\nQuarto content creation\nOpen index.qmd and update the landing page text. This is Markdown, so feel free to experiment with headings, lists, and formatting.\nNext, open aboutme.qmd and write a personal introduction:\n\nDescribe your background, interests, and experience with data analysis.\nInclude headings and subheadings.\nAdd a picture of yourself (store it in the repository and link it).\nAdd a link to a data-related resource you find interesting, with a short explanation.\nOptionally add extra content (tables, video, or other elements).\n\nSave and re-render the site to see your changes.\n\nThis portfolio website and everything you put on it is public. Do not post anything you want to keep private.\n\n\n\nWebsite control\nOpen _quarto.yml. This file controls the site title, navigation, and styling.\nMake the following changes:\n\nUpdate the site title.\nReplace URL-TO-THIS-REPOSITORY-HERE with the GitHub URL of your repository.\nTry a different theme and optionally a different syntax highlight scheme.\n\n\nYAML is very sensitive to indentation. A small spacing error can break rendering.\n\n\n\nSending updates to GitHub\nOnce you are happy with your updates, commit and push them:\n\nClose RStudio/Positron.\nOpen GitKraken (or your preferred Git client).\nStage changes, write a commit message, and commit.\nPush to GitHub.\n\n\nIf you ever need to force push, be aware that it overwrites remote history. It is usually better to resolve merge conflicts instead.\n\n\n\nMaking the website public\nEnable GitHub Pages for the repository:\n\nGo to your repository on github.com.\nOpen Settings → Pages.\nSet the branch to main and the folder to /docs.\nSave.\n\nYour site URL will look like https://username.github.io/yourname-MADA-portfolio/. It can take a minute for the site to appear.\n\n\nUpdate your repository README\nOpen README.md and add a sentence pointing to your website URL.
