You can mention specific skills in those documents, but you can’t really demonstrate them. This makes it difficult.\nEven if you are not looking for a new job, having your work and skills out there is a good way of having potential opportunities come your way. Say someone is looking for a speaker/presenter for an event who could talk about a particular topic. They might ask colleagues for recommendations, or search online. If you have work online that shows that you are proficient in that topic, you might be contacted.\nA more altruistic reason is that if you have knowledge in a certain area, sharing it publicly can potentially help others learn from you. Just think of the many times you looked for and found some useful information online. You can be the provider of such information too!"

This will download and install the dplyr package, which is a very useful package for data manipulation. To check if it worked, type library(dplyr).

Quarto is the successor of the R Markdown framework, which has been widely used for reproducible research and dynamic reporting in the R community.

    "section": "Why Quarto?",
    "text": "Why Quarto?\nTraditional methods of authoring scientific and technical documents often involve separate tools for analysis and presentation. For instance, code is written in some language such as R or Julia, then executed. The code produces output such as figures or tables, which might be copied into a Word document, or pasted into a PowerPoint presentation or onto a website. This separation of analysis and presentation is not efficient and creates challenges for reproducibility.\nThe idea for Quarto is that one can use one unified system that combines input, such as narrative text and executable code, with results such as figures and tables, and easily and automatically generates well-formatted output documents in the form of HTML, PDF, Word, and more. This can lead to a workflow that is much more automated, efficient and reproducible.",

    "section": "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)",
    "text": "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nAny kind of data analysis and modeling project, such as a QSP project, requires interacting with data, writing and debugging code, managing files, producing figures and tables, etc. It is convenient to do all this through a single interface, at least as much as possible. This is where the concept of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) comes in. It is a piece of software that not only lets you write code, but also allows you to do many other project functions through a single platform.\nAnother way to think of IDEs is that they are code editors with a lot of additional bells and whistles. The idea is that one has all the functionality one needs to not just write code, but also to run it and debug it, to look at results, to manage files, etc. in a single place. That’s what an IDE tries to do.\nMost IDEs share certain features:\n\nThe editor is where you write your code. It usually offers syntax highlighting, intelligent completion, and many other features that make coding life easier.\nThe console/terminal area (called panel in Positron) is where you can interact with other pieces of software, such as R and Julia, where you see error messages, and where you can debug.\nAn area (it is the left side bar for Positron) where you can interact with files, perform version control with GitHub, manage extensions, and other operations.\nAnother area (usually the right side bar in Positron) that shows outputs such as figures, allows you to interactively explore data and objects generated by your code, and provides further interactive functionality.\n\nHaving all these features inside one platform makes modern IDEs rather powerful. The flip-side is that it takes time getting used to all the functionality. But it’s generally worth the effort since IDEs make coding and related project work much more efficient. Most IDEs are highly configurable, so you can arrange the items you want to see and where to see them. We’ll discuss that a bit more shortly.",

    "text": "The Positron IDE\nSome IDEs focus on a specific programming language (e.g., RStudio), others are very language-agnostic (e.g., VS Code). Positron is a bit in the middle. It’s a fairly new IDE developed by the folks from Posit, who previously developed RStudio. The idea is that it’s an IDE that has strong integration for certain programming languages – currently the main focus is on R and Phython – while also allowing you to work with other languages, such as Julia.\nPositron is cross-platform and free. Because it’s from the same folks that created Quarto, it plays nicely with it. It has many of the nice, user-friendy features of RStudio, but has been designed to be more flexible, extensible and supporting more languages compared to RStudio.",

You might not be able to exactly follow the instructions we provide, but you should be able to get everything working in pretty much any IDE.",

This article describes how to do that (remember, Positron is basically a variant of VS Code, so the same concepts apply).",

You’ve already encountered the ‘Extensions’ view.Maybe the most important one is the first one, the file explorer view. You can use it to quickly open files and create new ones. The search is also a handy tool to find things quickly.

    "section": "Getting Extensions",
    "text": "Getting Extensions\nGetting extensions is easy. Just open the Extensions sidebar, by clicking the extension icon on the left sidebar in Positron (it looks like 4 squares, with one being away from the other 3). You’ll then see a list of extensions.\nFirst you see those that are installed. Positron comes with several pre-installed. If you just installed Positron, some extensions might need updating. Go ahead and update them. Some might need a restart of the extension (occasionally, you might have to fully restart Positron).\nNow, let’s install an additional extension. First, click on ‘Open’ -&gt; ‘Open File’ and open some CSV file on your computer. If you don’t have one readily available, ask your favorite AI to make you one, e.g. with a promt like “Generate a small, realistic dataset with 10 variables and 20 observations. Return the result as a downloadable CSV file.”\nThe file should open in the main window, and you should see a nicely formatted data frame. This formatting is courtesy of Positron, one of the many nice features of this IDE. But let’s say we don’t want to have it pre-formmatted by Positron. Click on the ‘Open as plain text file’ button on the top. This should open the CSV file as simple text, you’ll see entries separated by commas. That’s ok, but a bit hard to read. So let’s improve this with an extension.\nGo to the Extensions sidebar and search for ‘Rainbow CSV’. Click on the ‘Install’ button (trust the publisher). Now go back to your open CSV file. You should now see each column in a different color, courtesy of this new extension. This makes CSV files easier to read.\nThis was a very basic extension. Given that Positron already nicely formats CSV files, you might not need the extension. But there are several ones you definitely want for QSPL, such as Julia and Quarto. We’ll discuss those in the courses that cover the respective tools.\nTo learn a bit more about Positron extensions, and how they do and don’t differ from VS Code extensions, check out the Positron extensions page on the Positron documentation website.",

    "title": "Positron Extensions",
    "section": "Managing Extensions",
    "text": "Managing Extensions\nMany extensions have their own settings that allow you to adjust their behavoir. Simply click on the extension you want to customize, then click on the gear icon and go to Settings. For instance if you do that for the Quarto extension that comes pre-installed with Positron, you see a long list of settings you can change. There is for instance ‘Quarto &gt; Render &gt; Preview Type’. It’s by default set to internal, meaning Quarto documents are shown inside Positron. If you want to show them in the browser (we personally prefer that), you can change the setting to ‘external’. (If you don’t know yet what Quarto is and what rendering and preview means, you will once you go through our brief introduction to Quarto course 😁.\nYou can also turn on and off extensions. That can be helpful for specific situations. For instance there are various extensions that can give you access to AI support. It could be that you don’t want to use one of them for a while, since it is getting in the way of your coding or writing. You can then disable the extension by clicking on the gear icon, then on ‘Disable’ (you have to likely restart it). You can also disable extensions for specific projects (which Positron calls workspaces). Say you have some project with sensitive data where you don’t want AI to operate on. You can turn the AI off for that project/workspace.\nFinally, if you decide you don’t like an extension at all, just click on it completely uninstall it.\nLike packages in R or Julia, extensions can be of varying quality. In general, any additional extension makes Positron load slower and break more easily. We therefore recommend that you choose extensions cautiously. Start with those that are widely used and well supported. Add additional ones only if you really need them. You can always install them, try them, and then if they are not useful, uninstall them again.",

Things might still work even without some of these permissions, but it is better to have it fully set up and allow Positron access to everything it needs.\nOnce all the initial start-up things are done, Positron is ready to go. You should see the main screen with several different areas (called panes or panels), and a menu bar on the top and another one on the left. We’ll discuss the different parts of Positron shortly.\nYou might see one or several red notification dots on some of the icons on the left, asking you to update things or log in.

    "text": "Editing and running code\nPositron is meant for working with code. It is especically designed to work well with R and Python, but other languages are also supported, many through extensions. Let’s explore a small example with R. Go to “New” -&gt; “New File” and pick “R Script”. An empty file will open in the editor. Write a few lines of R code, for instance the following\n\nx = seq(1,100)\ny = x^2\nplot(x,y)\n\nNext, save the file somewhere. If Positron was ‘just an editor’, we would now have to switch over to R and run the code there. But with an IDE, we can do it all in one place. You should see a small triangle symbol in the top right corner of the editor. Press it to run the code. This will open the R console in the bottom window, execute the ‘source’ command to run the code, and show the resulting plot in the bottom window. In the top right window, you can also see the variables that were generated.\nLet’s say you want to have a line instead of circles for the plot but don’t remember the command. In the R console, you can type ?plot to call the help file for the plot function, which will show in a separate pane.\nOnce you found what you are looking for, change your code so it says plot(x,y,type='l') and run again. This time, instead of pressing the ‘run’ button, try to execute the code one line at a time. You can do that by starting in the first line and pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter. The first line will be executed, and you can then continue to the next line by pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter again. You will see the new plot show up. You should also see that the old plot is still there, you can go back to it with the arrows above the plot. The menu above the plot also allows you to save any of them, and do other things. It is generally not advised to do any steps manually, you should instead have code do all of it to ensure reproducibility.

GitHub is basically a web platform where you can store your projects in the cloud.\nYou can use Git without using GitHub. Other interfaces/platforms for Git exist, e.g., GitLab or Bitbucket. But the combination of Git and GitHub is the most common setup, and it is what we will be discussing.\nIn fact, since we will only be using Git through GitHub, we often tend to be sloppy with our language and not distinguish between the two. We might call it Git or GitHub, and possibly mean the other or both. Apologies in advance 😁. Mostly, we will refer to all of it as just GitHub."

    "text": "What to (not) use Git/GitHub for\nGitHub is ideal if you have a project with (possibly many) smallish files, and most of those files are text files (such as R code, LaTeX, Quarto/Markdown, etc.) and different people work on different parts of the project.\nGitHub is less useful if you have a lot of non-text files (e.g. Word or PowerPoint) and different team members might want to edit the same document at the same time. In that instance, a solution like Google Docs, Word+Dropbox, Word+Onedrive, etc. might be better.\nGitHub also has a problem with large files. Anything above around 100MB can lead to very slow syncing and sometimes outright failure. Unfortunately, once you have a failed attempt to sync a large file, it can be quite tricky to fix the repository to work again. Therefore keep large (&gt;100MB) files out of your GitHub repositories. If you have to work with such files, try to reduce them first before placing into the GitHub repository. Or as alternative, place those files in another sync service (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, GoogleDrive) and load them from there.\nFinally, if you have data, you need to be careful since by default, GitHub repositories (the GitHub name for your projects) are public and everyone can see them. You can set them private, but you need to be careful that you don’t accidentally expose confidential data to the public. It is in general not a good idea to have confidential data on GitHub. First anonymize your data enough that it is not at risk of identifiability, then you can place it in a private repository. If you put it public, be very careful that you only make things public that are ok to be made public."

    "text": "Git/GitHub terminology\nGit/GitHub has a lot of specialized terminology that takes getting used to. The GitHub folks posted a handy page with short descriptions of some of the important terms. Some of the terms you will encounter soon are Repository (also often called repo), User, Organization, Branch, Fork, Push, Pull, Commit and Stage. For some reason, the last term is not explained in the list linked to above. Staging is the step you need to do after you made changes and before you commit them. For pretty much all of my work, I find this a not too helpful extra step, but you need to know what it means and you need to do/use it as part of the GitHub workflow.\nEach repository can have multiple branches (think of it as alternative versions of all files, allowing different people to work on different aspects of a project with minimal interference). In this course, we won’t really use branches. We will mainly just work with a single branch. The name of the main branch can be anything, but these days the default is main. Until not too long ago, the main branch was referred to as master. This has mostly been discontinued, but you might still see occasionally some Github repositories where the main branch is called master. Again, the name can be in principle anything. Just be aware that master and main usually refer to the main branch."

    "text": "Programming Languages\nIn brief, programming languages are ways to get a computer to do things. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax (rules for how to write code), strengths and weaknesses, and areas of application. Some programming languages are general-purpose, meaning they can be used for a wide range of tasks (e.g., Python, Java, C++). Others are more specialized, designed for specific tasks or domains (e.g., R for statistics, SQL for database queries).\nFor data science type work, there are several popular programming languages, including R, Python, Julia, and MATLAB. Each of these languages has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use often depends on the specific needs of the project, the preferences of the team, and the existing ecosystem of tools and libraries."

    "text": "R strengths and weaknesses\nLike every programming language, R has its advantages and disadvantages. Feel free to do a web search on that topic, and you will encounter tons of people with tons of opinions. Some of the features that are useful to us are:\n\nR is Open Source, FREE, and cross-platform.\nR is a “high-level” programming language, relatively easy to learn (compared to Fortran, C, etc.).\nR comes with many integrated functions.\nR is great for statistics, data analysis, and graphics.\nThe R Community is very dynamic, helpful and welcoming.\nThrough R packages, it is easy to get lots of state-of-the-art algorithms.\nDocumentation and help files for R are generally good.\n\nWhile we use R in this course, it is not the only option to analyze data. Maybe the most similar to R, and widely used, is Python, which is also free. There is also commercial software that can be used to analyze data (e.g., Matlab, Mathematica, Tableau, SAS, SPSS). Other more general programming languages are suitable for certain types of analyses as well (e.g., C, Fortran, Perl, Java, Julia). Depending on your future needs or jobs, you might have to learn one or several of those additional languages. The good news is that even though those languages are all different, they all share general ways of thinking and structuring code. So once you understand a specific concept (e.g., variables, loops, branching statements or functions), it applies to all those languages. Thus, learning a new programming language is much easier once you already know one. And R is a good one to get started with."
