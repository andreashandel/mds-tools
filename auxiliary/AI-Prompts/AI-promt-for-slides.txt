The following instructions apply to the content inside the courses/fc1-intro-positron folder and subfolders.

Role: You are an expert Instructional Designer and Quarto/RevealJS Developer.

You are working inside my Quarto course repository. Your task is to generate a Quarto reveal.js slide deck for each unit, with consistent structure and style.

Goal

For each unit, create a high-quality, visually engaging presentation slide deck that I can later use to generate a video. For every unit .qmd file, create a companion slide deck .qmd file in the same folder with the same base name plus -slides appended.

Example:

path/to/positron-features.qmd → path/to/positron-features-slides.qmd

Do not overwrite any existing *-slides.qmd unless it is clearly a previous auto-generated draft with a marker comment you add (see below). If a -slides.qmd file already exists, rename it to -slides-old.qmd, then generate a new one.

Unit identification

A “unit” file is a .qmd that contains the block markers:

::: {.unit-overview} ... ::: <!-- end unit-overview div -->
(and usually the others: .unit-goals, .unit-reading, .unit-summary, .unit-resources, .unit-exercise)

Only generate slides for unit files that match this pattern. Skip index pages, landing pages, blog posts, etc.

Slide deck format & style

Use Quarto revealjs. Each deck must be self-contained and renderable on its own.

YAML header for every deck (use exactly this template, substituting the unit title):

---
title: "<UNIT TITLE>"
subtitle: "Companion slides"
format:
  revealjs:
    slide-number: true
    progress: true
    hash: true
    center: false
    navigation-mode: linear
    transition: fade
    background-transition: fade
    menu: true
    footer: "mds-tools • <UNIT TITLE>"
---

For each slide deck, use and as suitable modify the assets/slides.scss style file for styling. 


Required slide structure (consistent across units)

Each deck must contain these sections/slides in this order:

Title slide (implicit via YAML is fine)

Overview (from .unit-overview, 1–3 bullets)

Goals (from .unit-goals, bullet list)

Core content slides (from .unit-reading)

Create 1 slide per ## subsection inside the reading block

Each slide: 3–6 concise bullets (max ~10 words per bullet when possible)

If there are code examples in the subsection, include only the minimal snippet; prefer linking back to unit content rather than full code.

If a subsection is long, split into two slides with clear titles like “(Part 1)” “(Part 2)”.

Summary (from .unit-summary, 3–5 bullets)


Guidelines for Slide Creation:

Chunking & Pacing:

Do not create walls of text. Break long paragraphs into concise bullet points.

One distinct concept per slide.


Content transformation rules:

Slides must be summaries, not copy/paste of paragraphs.

Preserve key terminology and any “workflow steps”.

Keep the slide count reasonable: target 10–18 slides per unit. If the unit is very short, 6–10 is fine.

Do not invent factual claims. If something is uncertain, phrase it as guidance (“often”, “typically”, “a good default is…”).

Maintain consistent capitalization, punctuation, and bullet style.


Speaker Notes (Crucial):

For every single slide, add a :::{.notes} block at the bottom.

Write a conversational, engaging script for this section. Do not just repeat the bullets; explain the concept as if teaching a student. This script will be used for AI voice generation later.

Guidelines for notes:

Write like a spoken narration.

60–130 words per slide (keep it tight).

Use “you” phrasing, instructional tone.

If the slide references a demo or action, explicitly describe what to do.


Media & Visuals:

Existing Images: If the input text contains an image ![](), preserve it on the slide.

Mermaid Diagrams (New Media): If a concept involves a process, flow, or hierarchy, create a Mermaid diagram code chunk (````{mermaid}`) to visualize it. This creates "new media" directly in the code.

Image Placeholders: If a slide needs a visual but none exists (and a diagram isn't appropriate), create a suitable visual.


Layout & Formatting:

Use Two-Column Layouts as suitable to put text on the left and code/images on the right.

Markdown
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Text here...
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
Image or Code here...
:::
::::
If there is a code block, keep it short. If the original code is long, simplify it or split it across multiple slides.


File hygiene:

Add this marker comment at the top (right after YAML) in every generated deck:
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED SLIDES: edit freely; regenerate with care -->

Do not modify the original unit file.


Quality checks

After generating decks:

Ensure no decks are empty and each has the required sections.

Ensure each deck renders (if you can run Quarto render, do it; otherwise validate basic syntax).

Print a short summary report:

number of units processed

list of decks created

any units skipped and why

any warnings (e.g., missing unit blocks, overly long sections that forced splitting)

Create assets/_slide-rubric.md describing the structure and checklist you used, and refer to it while generating slides.
