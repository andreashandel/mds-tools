title: Using Julia Environments

# Overview

Here you will learn how Julia manages project‑specific dependencies through its built‑in package manager.

# Goals

* Create a new project environment and activate it.
* Add, update, and remove packages within that environment.
* Understand the role of `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` for reproducibility.

# Reading

Julia embeds a full‑featured package manager called `Pkg` directly in the standard library. Instead of installing packages globally, you create self‑contained environments that travel with your project. At the operating‑system prompt, change to the project directory and start the Julia REPL, then enter package mode with the `]` key. Typing `activate .` initializes a fresh environment in that folder, producing a `Project.toml` file that records package names and version constraints.

To add dependencies, still in package mode, run `add DataFrames Plots`. Pkg resolves compatibility, downloads the appropriate versions, and logs the exact build in `Manifest.toml`. Colleagues can reproduce your environment by cloning the repository and executing `julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'`.

Keeping packages up to date is as simple as `update`, while `remove PackageName` cleans out dependencies you no longer need. Because each project has its own environment, upgrading one set of packages won’t break another project. You can stack environments via the `JULIA_LOAD_PATH`; for instance, `Base` packages < `@stdlib` < `~/.julia/environments/v1.11` < your current project.

This composable, file‑based approach makes reproducibility first‑class: the combination of source code, `Project.toml`, and `Manifest.toml` fully specifies your computational environment.

# Summary

You now know how to create and manage isolated Julia environments, ensuring that your code runs the same today and in the future.

# Practice

1. Create an empty directory called `julia‑sandbox`, activate it as a project, and add the `HTTP` package. Inspect the generated `Project.toml`.
2. Share the directory with a friend and have them instantiate the environment on their machine.
