# Overview

This repository constitutes a website containing courses. These courses provide introduction to specific data science and modeling related tools. A final course provides instructions on using these tools to create an online portfolio.


# Structure

The repository and main folder are called mds-tools. The website is created using Quarto, and _quarto.yml and _brand.yml specify settings for the site.

The main content is inside the courses/ folder. Inside that folder, each course has its own folder and subfolders. 

Each unit consists of a main Quarto .qmd file. Every unit has the same structure, following the template given in auxiliary/templates/unit-template.qmd

Assets that are part of the website and used across the whole site are in the assets/ folder. 

Information and materials that are used to develop and maintain the website, but that are not part of the actual website, are in the auxiliary/ folder.

# Content and Style
