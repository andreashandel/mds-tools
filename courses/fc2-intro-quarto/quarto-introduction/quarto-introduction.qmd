## What is Quarto?

As it's most basic, Quarto is piece of (powerful) software that can take various input sources (text, code, etc.) and process them to produce well-formatted output documents that are a seamless combination of text, figures, tables and other elements. Quarto is the successor of the R Markdown framework, which has been widely used for reproducible research and dynamic reporting in the R community. Building upon R Markdown’s strengths, Quarto extends this capability to other languages like Python, Julia, and others. 


## Why Quarto?

Traditional methods of authoring scientific and technical documents often involve separate tools for analysis and presentation. For instance, code is written in some language such as R or Julia, then executed. The code produces output such as figures or tables, which might be copied into a Word document, or pasted into a PowerPoint presentation or onto a website. This separation of analysis and presentation is not efficient and creates challenges for reproducibility.

The idea for Quarto is that one can use one unified system that combines input, such as narrative text and executable code, with results such as figures and tables, and easily and automatically generates well-formatted output documents in the form of HTML, PDF, Word, and more. This can lead to a workflow that is much more automated, efficient and reproducible. 


## Applications of Quarto

Quarto is widely applicable in various scenarios:

- Academic publishing and reproducible research papers
- Data analysis reports and interactive dashboards
- Educational content and tutorials
- Professional reporting and documentation
- Websites (such as QSPL)
