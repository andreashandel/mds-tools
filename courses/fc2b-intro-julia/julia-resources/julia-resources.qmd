# Reading

Learning a language is a journey, and the Julia ecosystem offers multiple on‑ramps. The canonical reference is the online *Julia Manual*, which covers everything from basic syntax to advanced parallel programming. If you prefer curated video content, *JuliaAcademy* hosts free, instructor‑led courses that walk through practical projects such as climate modeling and machine learning.

Several books complement these resources. *Julia for Data Science* provides a hands‑on introduction for analysts coming from Python or R, while *Think Julia* presents computer‑science fundamentals using Julia as the teaching language. For numerical computing, *Numerical Linear Algebra with Julia* is a modern classic that leverages the language’s speed.

Community support is equally important. The Julia Discourse forum is the primary venue for technical questions, announcements, and package releases. Real‑time chat is available on Slack and Zulip, and many special‑interest groups meet virtually to discuss topics like GPU computing or differential equations. Attending the annual *JuliaCon* conference—either in person or remotely—is a great way to learn from and network with practitioners across disciplines.


## QSP and PMX specific resources

There is even a dedicated, though non-free package for pharmacometrics called [Pumas](https://docs.pumas.ai/stable/). Since Pumas is proprietary, we do not use it as part of QSPL, but if you have access to it, it might be worth checking out.

# Practice

1. Pick one resource above—manual chapter, video, or book—and work through the first example it presents.
2. Create an account on Discourse, post a brief introduction, and ask a simple Julia question.
