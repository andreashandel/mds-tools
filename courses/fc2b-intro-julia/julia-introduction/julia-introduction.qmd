## What is Julia

Julia is an open-source programming language designed for technical and scientific computing. It aims to be easy to write like Python or R while delivering performance closer to C or Fortran.

## Why Julia exists

Many data projects use a high-level language for exploration and a low-level language for performance. Julia was designed to reduce that split by offering a single language that can scale from quick analysis to production-grade performance.

## Where Julia is used

Julia is popular in areas such as numerical simulation, optimization, machine learning, and scientific computing. It is a good fit when you need both speed and a productive interactive workflow.

## How Julia fits this course

We will use Julia as another tool for data work. The focus is on practical tasks and basic fluency, not on advanced language features.

# Practice

* Skim the Julia website and note two example application areas.
* Write down one reason a single-language workflow can be useful.
* Identify one task where speed matters in your own work.
