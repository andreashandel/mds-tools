# Reading

Julia is an open‑source, high‑performance programming language designed at MIT and first released in 2012. Its creators set out to build a single language that feels as easy and productive as Python or R, yet rivals C and Fortran for speed. 

The language syntax is similar to languages such as MATLAB, Python, or R, but of course the details differ. 

As with many other programming languages, a lot of additional functionality is provided [through packages](https://julialang.org/packages/). While the Julia package system is not quite as exensive yet as that of R or Python, it keeps rapidly growing and there are many high-quality packages for scientific computing, machine learning, and data analysis. 

Because Julia was designed for interactive exploration **and** large‑scale deployment, it has found a home in disciplines ranging from computational biology and climate modeling to finance and astronomy. A vibrant global community contributes to the language and its ecosystem, making Julia an attractive choice for new projects that demand both productivity and speed.

Because it is newer and the community is smaller, some of the documentation and tutorials are not as exhaustive as for languages like Python or R.

# Summary

Julia is a fairly new programming language that tries to fill the gap between ease of use and high performance. While it is not yet as widely used as R or Python, it is rapidly growing in popularity.

# Practice

1. Visit the Julia website and skim the “Showcase” page to see real‑world uses of the language.
2. Write down two projects or fields you think could benefit from Julia in your own work.
