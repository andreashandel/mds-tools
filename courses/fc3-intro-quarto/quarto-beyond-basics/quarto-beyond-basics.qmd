## Quarto for presentations

Quarto can also be used to create presentations. Quarto supports multiple presentation formats, including HTML-based presentations using frameworks like Reveal.js and Beamer for PDF presentations.

To create a presentation, you start with a Quarto document (`.qmd`) and specify the presentation format in the YAML front matter. For example, to create a Reveal.js presentation, you would use:
```yaml
---
title: "My Presentation"
format: revealjs
---
```
You can then add slides using Markdown syntax, where each slide is separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).

## Quarto for websites

Quarto can also be used to create entire websites. A Quarto website is a collection of Quarto documents organized into a coherent structure, with navigation and theming options.

To create a Quarto website, you typically start by creating a new Quarto project and specifying the website format in the project configuration file (`_quarto.yml`). You can then add individual Quarto documents for each page of your website.
