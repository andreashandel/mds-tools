# Practice

### Practice Exercise

Follow the steps to install Quarto on your machine. Run `quarto check` to confirm the installation was successful.

### Substantial Exercise

Set up your IDE (Positron, VS Code, or Vim/Neovim) to work with Quarto. Create a simple Quarto document named `setup_test.qmd`, render it to HTML, and ensure it works correctly. Submit a brief summary of your installation experience, your `.qmd` file, and the rendered HTML.
