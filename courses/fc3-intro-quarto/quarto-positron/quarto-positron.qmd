## Positron and Quarto Integration

Positron is an intuitive, cross-platform IDE ideal for data science tasks. Due to your familiarity with Positron, this section will focus specifically on utilizing Positron's built-in features to streamline your Quarto workflow.

## Working with `.qmd` Files in Positron

Opening a `.qmd` file in Positron immediately:

- Activates syntax highlighting for YAML headers, Markdown text, and embedded code chunks (R, Python, Julia, Bash).
- Opens a live **Preview Pane**, refreshing automatically upon file save.
- Provides a convenient **Render Button** to execute `quarto render` without leaving the IDE.

## Rendering Documents

Rendering your document is straightforward:

- Click the **Render** button or use the shortcut <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + K</kbd>.
- Positron executes the rendering command (e.g., `quarto render`) and displays any output messages or warnings in the integrated terminal.

For example:

```bash
quarto render document.qmd --to html
```

The rendered document appears directly within Positron, allowing immediate inspection.

## Live Preview for HTML Documents

Positron supports live preview for HTML outputs through a built-in websocket server. This enables instant feedback on your edits without the need for manual rendering, providing a smooth, interactive authoring experience.

## Customizing Quarto Settings in Positron

Access Quarto customization via:

**Settings › Build Tools › Quarto**

Here, you can configure:

- Default output formats (useful when the YAML header doesn't specify `format:` explicitly).
- "Render on Save" behavior for automatic document updates.
- Real-time validation settings for specific programming languages.

These configurations are saved per project, facilitating consistency across team environments.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

If you encounter rendering issues, follow these steps:

1. Check the **Terminal** pane for the exact command executed by Positron.
2. Manually execute the command in your terminal to identify detailed error messages.
3. Run `quarto check` to confirm that all necessary dependencies and language engines are correctly installed.

This systematic approach simplifies the troubleshooting process, ensuring minimal disruption to your workflow.

::: {.unit-exercise}
# Practice

### Practice Exercise

Open an existing `.qmd` file in Positron. Practice rendering it as HTML and explore live-preview features.

### Substantial Exercise

Configure Positron settings to automatically render your Quarto documents on save. Write a brief Quarto report (`positron_demo.qmd`) with a YAML header, an introductory paragraph, and a simple data analysis chunk. Render your report and verify the setup. Submit your source `.qmd` file, rendered HTML, and a brief reflection on your experience.
