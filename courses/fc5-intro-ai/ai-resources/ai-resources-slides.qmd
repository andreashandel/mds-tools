In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit consists of a collection of links to AI, The focus is on generative, LLM AI tools. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## AI in general

- [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) is a Substack blog by Ethan Mollick where he discusses ideas around (generative) AI from a very applied user perspective. It is not modeling and data science focused, but still very useful general information and commentary, and very non-technical.
- [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) is a platform/company that offers a lot of teaching material related to AI. Some of the materials are free. They also have a great weekly newsletter.
- A really good (but non-free) book is [*Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans*](https://melaniemitchell.me/aibook/). The author, Melanie Mitchell, also has [an AI blog](https://aiguide.substack.com/) that is worth checking out.
- This [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-for-everyone) gives a brief, non-technical introduction to current LLM AI tools (such as GPT).

## Technical aspects of AI

- The [Deep Learning Chapter of *HOML*](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/deep-learning.html) provides a nice basic introduction.
- The [StatQuest YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) has multiple videos with nice explanations on various AI-related topics, at times going fairly deep into the technical details, while still being rather easy to understand.
