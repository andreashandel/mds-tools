## Introduction

Below is a curated list of resources grouped by theme. Use them to go deeper on specific topics, or to find a few reliable sources to follow over time.

## AI in general

* [One Useful Thing](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/) is a Substack blog by Ethan Mollick where he discusses ideas around (generative) AI from a very applied user perspective. It is not modeling and data science focused, but still very useful general information and commentary, and very non-technical.

* [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) is a platform/company that offers a lot of teaching material related to AI. Some of the materials are free. They also have a great weekly newsletter.

* A really good (but non-free) book is [*Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans*](https://melaniemitchell.me/aibook/). The author, Melanie Mitchell, also has [an AI blog](https://aiguide.substack.com/) that is worth checking out.

* This [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-for-everyone) gives a brief, non-technical introduction to current LLM AI tools (such as GPT).


## Technical aspects of AI

* The [Deep Learning Chapter of *HOML*](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/deep-learning.html) provides a nice basic introduction.

* The [StatQuest YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) has multiple videos with nice explanations on various AI-related topics, at times going fairly deep into the technical details, while still being rather easy to understand.
