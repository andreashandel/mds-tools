## Overview

- In this unit, we will **very** briefly talk about Artificial

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are In this unit, we will **very** briefly talk about Artificial. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Know what Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence are.
- Know how one can (maybe) use R for such tasks.

## Introduction

- Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere these days.
- AI approaches have led to some impressive recent technological advances,
- Most recently, we have seen LLM AI tools (which we'll
- Progress in AI will continue to be rapid and lead
- With everything "new and shiny" there comes a good bit
- The goal for this short unit is to give you

## Deep Learning (DL)

- You might also hear the term Deep Learning (DL) used
- Some folks distinguish DL and AI, considering the former a
- Deep Learning (DL) generally refers to using a specific class
- These days, DL is sometimes used a bit more loosely
- However, most often if someone says/writes that they use deep

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is definitely a trendy topic these days.
- It is widely used and also widely misused in many
- Roughly speaking, AI is the use of complex models, usually
- If one wanted to differentiate DL and AI, one might
- However, it seems these days that DL and AI are
- Overall, if you hear AI or DL, you can think
