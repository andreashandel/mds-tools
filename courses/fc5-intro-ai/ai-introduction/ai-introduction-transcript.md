# Introduction to AI Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are In this unit, we will **very** briefly talk about Artificial. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Know what Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence are., Know how one can (maybe) use R for such tasks. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on introduction and why it matters. The key ideas here are Artificial intelligence (AI) is everywhere these days., AI approaches have led to some impressive recent technological advances,, Most recently, we have seen LLM AI tools (which we'll. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on neural networks (nn) and why it matters. The key ideas here are Currently, the main workhorse of artificial intelligence (AI) is a, These are specific kinds of models that originated as an, While neural nets have been around for a while and. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on deep learning (dl) and why it matters. The key ideas here are You might also hear the term Deep Learning (DL) used, Some folks distinguish DL and AI, considering the former a, Deep Learning (DL) generally refers to using a specific class. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 6

In this slide, we focus on artificial intelligence (ai) and why it matters. The key ideas here are Artificial Intelligence (AI) is definitely a trendy topic these days., It is widely used and also widely misused in many, Roughly speaking, AI is the use of complex models, usually. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 7

In this slide, we focus on dl and ai in r and why it matters. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 8

In this slide, we focus on summary and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit provided a brief introduction to neural networks, deep, It also highlighted that R can interface with tools like, It also highlighted that R can interface with tools like. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide.
