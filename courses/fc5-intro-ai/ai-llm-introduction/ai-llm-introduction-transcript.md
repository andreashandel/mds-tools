# Introduction to LLM AI tools Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit provides an introduction to the use of Large. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Know of ways to think about LLM AI tools., Understand strengths, weaknesses and dangers of using AI. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on introduction and why it matters. The key ideas here are AI is a broad field, and there are different AI, You can potentially use some of them to analyze your, We discussed this in a previous unit. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on llm ai conceptual frameworks and why it matters. The key ideas here are AI, and especially generative AI like LLMs are very new, Everyone is still trying to figure out how to use, While one can obviously use these tools without much further. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on tips for best practices and why it matters. The key ideas here are Use them a lot. The more you use them, the better you will get at it, and the more you will understand what they can and cannot do., Think carefully about what exactly you want to the AI to accomplish and provide instructions that are as detailed and specific as possible. These days, this is often called **prompt engineering**., Iterate. Often the first version you get from the AI will not exactly what you want. You can try to ask the AI to rewrite/change/fix things. Or you can manually edit the code, which you can then use as input to ask the AI to make further changes. As you study this,

## Slide 6

In this slide, we focus on shortcomings and dangers of ai tools and why it matters. The key ideas here are For all its promises, the LLM AI tools continue to, The following topics are most relevant in the context of, When you use AI to help with data analysis, you. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 8

In this slide, we focus on summary and why it matters. The key ideas here are AI tools can be very useful tools to help you, It is useful to think about what AI tools are, It is always importont to keep in mind the risks. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
