## Overview

- This unit provides an introduction to the use of Large

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit provides an introduction to the use of Large. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Know of ways to think about LLM AI tools.
- Understand strengths, weaknesses and dangers of using AI.

## Introduction

- AI is a broad field, and there are different AI
- You can potentially use some of them to analyze your
- We discussed this in a previous unit.
- The focus here is on AI tools that can help
- Currently, the best tools for that are those based on
- For simplicity, we are going to call them AI tools

## LLM AI conceptual frameworks

- AI, and especially generative AI like LLMs are very new
- Everyone is still trying to figure out how to use
- While one can obviously use these tools without much further
- Below are a few conceptual frameworks that I have heard
- This view comes up repeatedly.
- The idea is that you should think of LLM AI

## Tips for best practices

- Use them a lot. The more you use them, the better you will get at it, and the more you will understand what they can and cannot do.
- Think carefully about what exactly you want to the AI to accomplish and provide instructions that are as detailed and specific as possible. These days, this is often called **prompt engineering**.
- Iterate. Often the first version you get from the AI will not exactly what you want. You can try to ask the AI to rewrite/change/fix things. Or you can manually edit the code, which you can then use as input to ask the AI to make further changes.
- Try different tools. Performance between tools from competing companies, or even different AI models from the same company, can produce widely varying results. If one tool does not give you a satisfactory answer, try another one.
- When you use AI to help with coding, ask the AI to add a lot of comments into the code to explain what each line of code does.
- Ask the AI to explain its reasoning, make it provide references, ask it to give specific examples. All of this helps you understand what the AI is doing, and helps you assess if the output makes sense.
