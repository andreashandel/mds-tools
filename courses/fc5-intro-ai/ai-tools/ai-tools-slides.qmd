## Overview

- This is a brief introduction to some currently available LLM
- This is a quickly changing area, so be sure to

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This is a brief introduction to some currently available LLM, This is a quickly changing area, so be sure to. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Be familiar with current AI tools and when/how to use them.
- Know what tools work nicely with R, Quarto and Positron.

## Introduction

- It seems that every month a new LLM AI tool
- They keep getting better fairly rapidly.
- As you use these tools, it's definitely useful to play
- The following sections describe some of the currently available LLM

## Main LLM AI tools

- Currently, the main LLM AI tools that are widely used
- Microsoft is using versions of OpenAI's models in their Copilot.
- Other tools from Meta (LLaMA) and others also exist, but
- Almost all of the major players provide free access to
- The more powerful ones tend to be much better, so
- That said, even the free ones can be quite useful.

## Positron AI tools

- One of the great features of Positron is that it
- It comes with a built-in AI assistant that you can
- You can access it by clicking on the _Positron Assistant_
- You will have to configure the assistant to work with
- The assistant is under rapid development.
- It therefore doesn't make too much sense to provide details

## R LLM AI tools

- R has several packages that allow you to interact with
- The most comprehensive and best supported one is probably the
- It provides a unified interface to several LLM AI tools.
- The `ellmer` website has good tutorials and documentation to get
- Another interesting package is the [btw package](https://posit-dev.github.io/btw/) which allows you
- The [vitals R package](https://vitals.tidyverse.org/) is another interesting package.

## Summary

- LLM AI tools are changing rapidly, both the underlying foundation
- The ones described above are great starting points.
- The important thing is to try existing ones, and keep
