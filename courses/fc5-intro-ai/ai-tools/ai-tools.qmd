# Overview

This is a brief introduction to some currently available LLM AI tools useful for coding and data analysis tasks, especially within our tool stack.

This is a quickly changing area, so be sure to explore and try out new tools as they become available.

## Introduction

It seems that every month a new LLM AI tool is announced. They keep getting better fairly rapidly. As you use these tools, it's definitely useful to play around and explore. 

The following sections describe some of the currently available LLM AI tools, with a focus on our topic of modeling and data science, and our tool stack of R, Quarto and Positron.


## Main LLM AI tools

Currently, the main LLM AI tools that are widely used are from OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Gemini) and Anthropic (Claude). Microsoft is using versions of OpenAI's models in their Copilot. Other tools from Meta (LLaMA) and others also exist, but are less widely used at this point in time.

Almost all of the major players provide free access to their less powerful models, and paid access to their more powerful ones. The more powerful ones tend to be much better, so in general, trying to get access to those flagship models is a good idea. 

That said, even the free ones can be quite useful.


## Positron AI tools

One of the great features of Positron is that it provides great AI integration. It comes with a built-in AI assistant that you can use to get help with coding and data analysis tasks. You can access it by clicking on the _Positron Asisstant_ icon in the left sidebar. 




## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is currently free for students with the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) I asked you to sign up for. Set it up by following the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/copilot).

Once you have Copilot activated, you can use it in R Studio. (It is also possible to use it with other popular editors, such as VS Code, but for this course I will focus on R Studio. If you prefer to code in VS Code, you can install the Copilot plugin).

To get Copilot working in R Studio, follow these [instructions](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html). You might want to leave Copilot indexing unchecked for now. The instruction guide explains what this is. Basically, if you check this, copilot can access all files that are part of your current project. This can lead to confidentiality issues. Therefore, only check it if you are sure that all files in your project are ok being shared with the AI (and possibly make their way to Github/Microsoft/OpenAI servers).

Once you have Copilot up and running, you should see it show up in the bottom of your R Studio input window (the top right window where you write code). It will start suggesting things as you type, once you stop for a few seconds. You can set that time in the options.

An introduction to using Copilot can be found in [this video](https://youtu.be/TlzMKSE97MQ?si=Tc3sQ5ZF3RktWsqF) by Thomas Mock from Posit/RStudio. In general, if you want bigger chunks of code, it seems currently better to go straight to ChatGPT. Copilot seems most useful to help you write bits of code as you go along. It can also be useful to help you remember the names of functions and arguments. [This blog post](https://github.blog/2023-06-20-how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/) provides some additional useful information on how to best use Copilot.

**In general, I recommend you turn off Copilot in RStudio when you are not actively using it.** And before you turn it on, make sure the document you have open, and any other files it might have access to, do not contain information you want to keep private.


## Other tools


For instance, as you learned from Thomas Mock's video above, the [`chattr` R package](https://mlverse.github.io/chattr/) seems like another great way to use ChatGPT from within R. Unfortunately, as of this writing, I haven't been able to get it to work. It is not entirely clear to me based on the information provided on the `chattr` website, but I think this is because talking to ChatGPT via the API (which is what `chattr` does) requires a paid account.


I'm also aware of the [chatAI4R](https://kumes.github.io/chatAI4R/) R package, but haven't tried it yet. My guess is since it likely also talks to ChatGPT through their API, it also requires a paid account. If that's not the case and you try it and find it useful, please report back!

As you are probably aware, AI tools are changing rapidly. I'm writing this in December 2023, you will read this a few months later. It could be that by this point, some new versions of AI tools have come out that are even better. Do explore and if you find some especially promising platform or package, let me know!
