# Using AI for coding Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are In this unit, we discuss using LLM AI tools to. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Know how and why to use current LLM AI tools to help with coding., Be familiar with several approaches of LLM AI assisted coding. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on introduction and why it matters. The key ideas here are If you write code, there are (at least) two major, First, you have to figure out what exactly you want, Second, you need to write a bunch of commands in. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on good prompting and why it matters. The key ideas here are To get good results from the AI, it is important, Try this prompt with one of the LLM AI:, Try this prompt with one of the LLM AI:. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on summary and why it matters. The key ideas here are Be as detailed and specific as possible., Iterate. Either only AI-based iterations or a mix of manual and AI iterations., Try different AI engines or settings or prompt phrasing. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
