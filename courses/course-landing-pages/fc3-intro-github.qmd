# Course Overview

This course provides a brief introduction to Git and GitHub.

It does not cover the full Git/GitHub workflow, but is enough to get you started and provide you with the necessary knowledge to be able to use Git/GitHub as part of your QSPL learnings - and hopefully beyond.

This course focuses on the _how_ of Git/GitHub, and only briefly talks about the big-picture for _why_ to sue Git/GitHub. The latter is covered - among many other topics - in our [ROADy workflow course](/courses/course-landing-pages/mc3-roady-workflows.qmd).
