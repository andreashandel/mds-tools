# Course Overview

This course provides a brief introduction to Git and GitHub.

It does not cover the full Git/GitHub workflow, but is enough to get you started and provide you with the necessary knowledge to be able to start using Git/GitHub.

This course focuses on the _how_ of Git/GitHub, and only briefly talks about the big-picture for _why_ to use Git/GitHub. 
<!-- The latter is covered - among many other topics - in our [ROADy workflow course](/courses/course-landing-pages/mc3-roady-workflows.qmd). -->

# Course Prerequisites

We show how to use Git/GitHub with Positron. For that, you should be familiar with Positron at least at the level covered in our [**Brief Introduction to Positron** course](fc1-intro-positron.qmd). 

If you don't want to use Git/GitHub through Positron, you can skip that part of the course and still follow along with the rest.
