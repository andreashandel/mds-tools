## Introduction

In our context, a portfolio is an organized collection of work that showcases skills and experience. Since the work is generally code, text and other digital content, you can easily place your portfolio online.



## Why have a portfolio

It is useful to showcase your skills for several reasons.

If you are looking for a new job, the application materials you submit, such as cover letter and CV or resume, generally need to be fairly short. You can mention specific skills in those documents, but you can't really demonstrate them. This makes it difficult.

Even if you are not looking for a new job, having your work and skills out there is a good way of having potential opportunities come your way. Say someone is looking for a speaker/presenter for an event who could talk about a particular topic. They might ask colleagues for recommendations, or search online. If you have work online that shows that you are proficient in that topic, you might be contacted.

A more altruistic reason is that if you have knowledge in a certain area, sharing it publicly can potentially help others learn from you. Just think of the many times you looked for and found some useful information online. You can be the provider of such information too!


## How to make a portfolio

An online portfolio is basically a website. This could be a stand-alone page, or it could be part of your general website. Any tool that allows you to make online content and place it on a sever can work. There are many free tools. As we'll discuss shortly, we like using Quarto and Git/Github, but many other options exist. Wordpress is a very common platform.

# Practice
Before creating your own portfolio, it is worth checking out some examples from others. This gives you an idea of ways you can make one and what to showcase. Here are a few nice ones. We picked those that are either topically relevant (data analysis and QSP in pharma) or use the tools we also use (mainly Quarto).
