## Quarto content creation

- Talk a bit about yourself, your background, training, research interests. Let us know what kind of statistics, modeling, programming, data analysis experience you already have. I’d also be curious to know what you most hope to learn in this course. And then tell us some quirky/interesting/curious thing about you.
- Include a picture of yourself. To do so, place the picture in the repository and link it from the Quarto file.
- Include a link to a picture/video/website/etc. The linked material should be somehow related to data analysis. Find something that you think is really cool/interesting/weird/etc. Provide a few explanatory sentences.
- If you want, feel free to get creative and include other things, e.g., you can try to include a table or a video or any other elements you want to explore.
