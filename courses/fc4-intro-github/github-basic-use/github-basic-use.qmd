# Reading

## Clone a repository

Cloning copies a GitHub repository to your computer. After cloning, you work locally and sync changes to GitHub.

## Check status and stage changes

Use your Git client to see which files changed. Stage the changes you want to include in the next commit. This lets you group related edits together.

## Commit with a clear message

Commit messages should be short and specific. A good pattern is: **verb + object** (e.g., "Add data cleaning script").

## Pull before you push

Always pull before you push to reduce conflicts. If changes exist on GitHub, pull first, resolve any conflicts, then push.

## Keep commits small

Small commits make it easier to review and undo changes. If a change is unrelated, make a separate commit.

# Summary

The core workflow is: clone, edit, stage, commit, pull, and push. If you follow that order and keep commits small, GitHub becomes predictable and easy to use.

# Test yourself

```{r github-basic-use-quiz}
#| echo: false
#| results: "asis"
# quizzes <- list("github-basic-use-quiz-1.Rmd", "github-basic-use-quiz-2.Rmd", "github-basic-use-quiz-3.Rmd")

::: {.unit-exercise}
# Practice

1. Clone a repository to your computer.
2. Edit two different files and stage the changes.
3. Create two separate commits with clear messages.
4. Pull and then push your changes to GitHub.
