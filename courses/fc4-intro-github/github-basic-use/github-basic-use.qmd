## Git/GitHub terminology

Git/GitHub has a lot of specialized terminology that takes getting used to. The GitHub folks posted a [handy page with short descriptions of important terms](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary). Some of the terms you will encounter soon are *Repository* (also often called *repo*), *User*, *Organization*, *Branch*, *Fork*, *Push*, *Pull*, *Commit* and *Stage*. *Staging* is the step you need to do after you made changes and before you commit them. You need to know what it means and you need to do/use it as part of the GitHub workflow.

Each repository can have multiple branches (think of it as alternative versions of all files, allowing different people to work on different aspects of a project with minimal interference). In this course, we will mainly just work with a single branch. The name of the main branch can be anything, but these days the default is `main`. Until not too long ago, the main branch was referred to as `master`.

### Basic terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| repository | collection of commits + branches |
| commit | recorded snapshot with message & hash |
| branch | movable pointer to a commit history |
| clone | local copy of a remote repository |
| push / pull | sync local and remote histories |



## Clone a repository

Cloning copies a GitHub repository to your computer. After cloning, you work locally and sync changes to GitHub.

## Clone a repository

Use **File → Clone repository** and select a repo from your GitHub account. Choose a local folder that is not synced by Dropbox or OneDrive.



## Make and commit changes

1. Edit a file in your project.
2. In GitHub Desktop, review changes in the **Changes** tab.
3. Write a clear commit message and click **Commit to main** (or the current branch).



## Pull and push

- **Pull** to bring remote changes to your computer before you start work.
- **Push** to upload your local commits to GitHub.

If GitHub Desktop reports conflicts, open the affected file and resolve the conflicts manually, then commit the resolution.


## Check status and stage changes

Use your Git client to see which files changed. Stage the changes you want to include in the next commit. This lets you group related edits together.

## Commit with a clear message

Commit messages should be short and specific. A good pattern is: **verb + object** (e.g., "Add data cleaning script").

## Pull before you push

Always pull before you push to reduce conflicts. If changes exist on GitHub, pull first, resolve any conflicts, then push.

## Keep commits small

Small commits make it easier to review and undo changes. If a change is unrelated, make a separate commit.

# Summary

The core workflow is: clone, edit, stage, commit, pull, and push. If you follow that order and keep commits small, GitHub becomes predictable and easy to use.

# Test yourself

```{r github-basic-use-quiz}
#| echo: false
#| results: "asis"
# quizzes <- list("github-basic-use-quiz-1.Rmd", "github-basic-use-quiz-2.Rmd", "github-basic-use-quiz-3.Rmd")
# exams2forms::exams2forms(file = quizzes, title = 'github-basic-use-quiz')
```

::: {.unit-exercise}
# Practice

1. Clone a repository to your computer.
2. Edit two different files and stage the changes.
3. Create two separate commits with clear messages.
4. Pull and then push your changes to GitHub.
