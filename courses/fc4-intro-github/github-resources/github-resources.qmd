# Reading

## Official documentation

The official documentation for Git and GitHub is extensive and well maintained. 
You can find the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/) on the GitHub website and the [Git learn section](https://git-scm.com/learn) on the Git website.



## Community Resources

The [GitHub community site](https://github.com/community) is a good place to ask questions and find answers related to GitHub.

There is even a game, called [Oh My Git!](https://ohmygit.org/) that is meant to teach you Git while playing. We have not tried it, so we don't know if it's entertaining and/or useful.
