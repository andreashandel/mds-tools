::: {.unit-overview}
# Overview

Commits capture snapshots of your work, and branches let you experiment without breaking the main line of development. This unit introduces both concepts.

# Goals

* Understand what a commit represents.
* Write clear, meaningful commit messages.
* Create and switch branches safely.
* Merge simple branches back into main.

# Reading

## Commits

A commit is a snapshot of your project at a point in time. Each commit has an ID, a message, and a parent history.

### Good commit messages

- Use a short verb phrase: "Add README", "Fix plot labels".
- Keep commits focused on one change.
- Avoid vague messages like "updates".

## Branches

A branch is a pointer to a line of commits. Use branches to:

- Try a risky change without affecting main.
- Work on a feature while keeping main stable.
- Separate tasks (e.g., documentation vs. analysis).

### Basic branch workflow

1. Create a branch.
2. Make commits on that branch.
3. Merge the branch back into `main` once it is ready.

If a merge conflict occurs, Git will pause and ask you to resolve the conflicting files.

# Summary

Commits are the building blocks of project history, and branches help you work safely in parallel. Small, well-labeled commits make collaboration easier.

# Test yourself

```{r github-commits-branches-quiz}
#| echo: false
#| results: "asis"
# quizzes <- list("github-commits-branches-quiz-1.Rmd", "github-commits-branches-quiz-2.Rmd", "github-commits-branches-quiz-3.Rmd")
# exams2forms::exams2forms(file = quizzes, title = 'github-commits-branches-quiz')
```

<!-- end unit-quiz div -->


::: {.unit-exercise}
# Practice

1. Create a new branch called `draft-notes`.
2. Make two commits on that branch.
3. Merge the branch into `main`.
4. Delete the branch after merging.
