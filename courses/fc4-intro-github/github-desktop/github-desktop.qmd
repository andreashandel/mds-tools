# Reading

## Install and sign in

Download GitHub Desktop from <https://desktop.github.com/> and sign in with your GitHub account.

## Clone a repository

Use **File → Clone repository** and select a repo from your GitHub account. Choose a local folder that is not synced by Dropbox or OneDrive.

## Make and commit changes

1. Edit a file in your project.
2. In GitHub Desktop, review changes in the **Changes** tab.
3. Write a clear commit message and click **Commit to main** (or the current branch).

## Pull and push

- **Pull** to bring remote changes to your computer before you start work.
- **Push** to upload your local commits to GitHub.

If GitHub Desktop reports conflicts, open the affected file and resolve the conflicts manually, then commit the resolution.
