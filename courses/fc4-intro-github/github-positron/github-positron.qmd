# Reading

## Enable Git for a project

If you cloned a repository, Git is already enabled. If you started from a local folder:

1. Open the project in Positron.
2. Initialize Git for the folder (or use a Git client to do it).
3. Connect to a remote repository on GitHub.

## Check status and stage files

Use the Git panel to view modified files. Stage files you want to include in the next commit. Staging is a way to choose exactly which changes are committed together.

## Commit changes

Write a short, descriptive commit message. Good commit messages describe *what changed* and *why*.

## Pull, then push

Before pushing, pull to make sure you have the latest changes from GitHub. If there are conflicts, Positron will show you which files need attention.

## When to switch tools

Positron works well for most day-to-day Git tasks. If you need advanced features (complex merges, rebases, or repository cleanup), use a dedicated Git client or the command line.
