# Reading

So far, we used GitHub Desktop to interact with GitHub. An alternative is to use Positron's built-in Git support. This allows you to perform common Git tasks without leaving the IDE. 

The GitHub Desktop application is generally a bit more user- and beginner-friendly, but Positron's Git integration is convenient for day-to-day use. It is ok to use a mix of both tools as needed.


## Git/GitHub in Positron

Positron has built-in Git support. You can find it on the left sidebar, it is generally the third icon from the top (the icon looks like a branch with a dot at each end). If you have a project open that is also a GitHub repository, you will see information in the Git panel that shows you what files have changed (top part) and the history of your project (bottom part).

Through this panel, you can do the same push/pull/commit workflow as in GitHub Desktop, but without leaving Positron.

## Positron and Git/GitHub workflow

Let's go through a minimal Git workflow in Positron. Open the Github repository you created earlier. You might even have it already open if you followed along in previous units.

If you recently did a push/pull with GitHub Desktop, the panel showing changes should be empty. You will also see in the bottom panel that the `main` symbol (your local repo) and the `origin/main` symbol (the remote repo on GitHub) are in sync and on the same line.

## Commit changes

Write a short, descriptive commit message. Good commit messages describe *what changed* and *why*.

## Pull, then push

Before pushing, pull to make sure you have the latest changes from GitHub. If there are conflicts, Positron will show you which files need attention.

## When to switch tools

Positron works well for most day-to-day Git tasks. If you need advanced features (complex merges, rebases, or repository cleanup), use a dedicated Git client or the command line.
