## Install Git

Install Git on your computer. Go to the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and follow the isntructions. You can accept the default options during installation. It is likely that you will need administrator rights to be able to install Git. 


## Set up GitHub

Go to [the GitHub website](https://github.com/) and create an account. The email you use should be one you use regularly, ideally one that you is your permanent email address. This will be the email address to which GitHub sends notifications. Next, choose a user name and pasword to finish setting up your account.

:::{.note}
GitHub is widely used professionally. You might use it for your career and you might want to allow other people to see your GitHub presence. You should therefore use a future-proof, professional user name for your GitHub account. Your name is always a good idea.
::: 

Since you are doing a lot of GitHub work out in the open, it is a good idea to associate a professional image with your profile. This also makes it easier for others to recognize that it's you who when they are for instance trying to invite as a collaborator. You can do so by going to your profile and changing the image. You can also add further information to your profile, such as a short bio, your location, and a link to your website or blog.


## Install GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a free graphical client made by the GitHub folks that makes it fairly easy to use Git/GitHub without the command line. [Download GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) and install it. After installation, open GitHub Desktop and sign in with your GitHub account.
