## Overview

- The workflow we covered so far generally suffices for basic
- But if you want to collaborate with others, or want
- Three important ones are branches, forks, and pull requests.

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are The workflow we covered so far generally suffices for basic, But if you want to collaborate with others, or want, Three important ones are branches, forks, and pull requests. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Know ways to collaborate with others on GitHub.
- Know what branches are and when to use them.
- Understand when and how to use a fork.
- Be able to open and merge a pull request.

## Collaborators

- GitHub is great for collaboration.
- There are two main ways to collaborate on GitHub: as
- To add collaborators to your repository, go to the repository
- You can then search for GitHub user names or email
- Once they accept the invitation, they can push changes directly
- This is the simplest way to collaborate if you trust

## Branches

- Each repository can have multiple branches (think of it as
- Often, using just a single branch is all you need.
- The name of the main branch can be anything, but
- Until not too long ago, the main branch was referred
- As you work on your repository, make commits and push/pull,
- You can create additional branches to isolate your work.

## Forks

- To be able to use branches, you need to be
- In contrast, you can fork any public repository.
- A fork is a personal copy of someone else's repository.
- While you can only contribute directly to a repository to
- Forks are commonly used when you want to contribute to

## Making a fork

- Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want
- This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub
- This is now your repository _forever_.
- You can clone it to your computer, make changes, and
- If you plan on working on the fork and later

## Open a pull request (PR)

- Assume that you forked a repository because you wanted to
- You cloned your fork to your computer, made some changes,
- Next, you ask the owner of the original repository to
- This last part is called issuing a **pull request**.
- You are requesting that the other person *pull* your changes
- Maybe thinking of it as *merge* requests or *sync* requests
