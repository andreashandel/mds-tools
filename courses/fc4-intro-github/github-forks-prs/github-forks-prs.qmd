# Reading

## When to fork

Use a fork when you want to contribute to a repository you do not have write access to. Your fork is your own copy under your account.

## Fork and clone

1. Click **Fork** on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your computer.
3. Create a branch for your changes.

## Keep your fork up to date

Add the original repository as an "upstream" remote so you can pull updates:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL/REPO.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Open a pull request (PR)

Push your branch to your fork, then open a pull request from your branch to the original repository. Provide a clear summary of what changed and why.

::: {.unit-summary}
# Summary

Forks let you work independently, and pull requests let you propose changes back to the original project. Keep your fork synced to avoid conflicts.
