# Overview

The basic workflow we covered earlier works well for basic solo work. But if you want to collaborate with others, or want to do more complex projects, GitHub offers additional features. Three important ones are branches, forks, and pull requests.

## Collaborators

GitHub is great for collaboration. There are two main ways to collaborate on GitHub: as *collaborators* on the same repository, or via *forks* and *pull requests*. 

To add collaborators to your repository, go to the repository on GitHub, click on **Settings** > **Manage access** > **Invite collaborators**. You can then search for GitHub user names or email addresses to invite people. Once they accept the invitation, they can push changes directly to your repository. This is the simplest way to collaborate if you trust the people you are working with. 

A potential problem with this approach is that multiple people might work on the same files at the same time, leading to *merge conflicts* when changes are pushed. To avoid this, collaborators often create separate *branches* for their work.


## Branches

Each repository can have multiple branches (think of it as alternative versions of all files, allowing different people to work on different aspects of a project with minimal interference). 

Often, using just a single branch is all you need. The name of the main branch can be anything, but these days the default is `main`. Until not too long ago, the main branch was referred to as `master`, you might still see that term occasionally.

As you work on your repository, make commits and push/pull, you are creating a line along the `main` branch. You can create additional branches to isolate your work. For instance if you want to try out a new feature, you can create a new branch for that feature. This way, your work on the new feature does not affect the `main` branch until you are sure your new feature works. At this point, you can merge your branch back into the `main` one. 

Branches are useful for projects with collaborators. Different individuals can work on different parts, and once things work, they can contribute their changes back to the main branch. 


## Forks

To be able to use branches, you need to be an owner or member of a repository. In contrast, you can fork any public repository. A fork is a personal copy of someone else's repository. While you can only contribute directly to a repository to which you have been added as collaborator, you can fork any public repository and make changes to your copy of the repository (your fork) without needing permission from the original owner and without affecting the original repository. Forks are commonly used when you want to contribute to a project that you do not have write access to.


## Making a fork 

Go to the GitHub page of the repository you want to fork, and click on the **Fork** button at the top right. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account. This is now your repository _forever_. You can clone it to your computer, make changes, and push them to your fork without affecting the original repository.

If you plan on working on the fork and later contributing to the original repository with a pull request (see below), you want to make sure you occasionally check to make sure your fork is up to date with the original repository. 



## Open a pull request (PR)

Assume that you forked a repository because you wanted to contribute some improvements. You cloned your fork to your computer, made some changes, committed them, and pushed the branch to your fork on GitHub.

Next, you ask the owner of the original repository to incorporate the updates you made in the fork into their main repository. This last part is called issuing a **pull request**. You are requesting that the other person *pull* your changes into their repository, hence the at times confusing (at least for us) terminology. Maybe thinking of it as *merge* requests or *sync* requests is better, i.e. you are requesting that they merge or sync your changes into their repository. You'll find the terminology *merge request* is used at times. If the person who controls the main repository likes your changes, they will *merge* your fork into the main branch. And just like that, you have contributed to some project becoming better! 

To open a pull request, go to your fork on GitHub. You should see a button that says **Compare & pull request**. Click on it. You will be taken to a page where you can provide a title and description of your changes. Be clear about what you changed and why. Once you are satisfied, click on **Create pull request**. The owner of the original repository should receive a notification that someone created a pull request.



## Merge a pull request

# Summary

Forks let you work independently, and pull requests let you propose changes back to the original project. Keep your fork synced to avoid conflicts.

# Practice

1. Fork a small public repository.
2. Create a branch and make a small change.
3. Open a pull request back to the original repo with a clear description.
