In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit covers R packages, and how to install and. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Installing and loading R packages

- There are tens of thousands of packages available, some big,
- We'll be using many different packages in this course.
- Of course, you are free to install and use any
- The "official" place for packages is the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html).
- To install a package from CRAN, go to the R
- Often, a package needs other packages to work (called dependencies),

```text
install.packages('DSAIRM')
```

## Note about R packages

- The quality of R packages varies.
- In general, if they are on `CRAN` or `Bioconductor`, they
- That does however not mean that the functions do the
- Other packages might be more experimental, and while they might
- In general, packages that are used by many people, packages
- That said, there are many packages that are developed by
