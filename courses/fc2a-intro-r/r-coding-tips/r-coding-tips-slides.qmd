In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit discusses a few (R) coding tips that are. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Be familiar with some general good coding practices.
- Be aware of some pitfalls related to R packages.
- Know a few R coding tips to make your code more efficient and easier to read.

## General Coding Tips

- Here are a few brief suggestions for good coding practices
- **Write modular code.** The idea is that you break things
- For instance R Markdown chunks are little modules.
- Each chunk should do some actions that make sense to
- For instance one or a few data cleaning steps can
- Then for the next set of actions (e.g.

## R packages

- Sometimes when you install or update a package, you might get the message **`Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?`** What that means is that there is an R package available that has just been updated and exists as *source* but not yet turned into what's called a *binary* format that's pre-compiled for whatever operating system you use. There is almost never a reason to get the very latest *source* version. And if you want to install from source, you might need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to do so. **Therefore, I suggest that when you get this question/message, you check `No`.**
- Sometimes during install or updating of a package, you might get a **`package is loaded/in use`** message. You are usually offered to restart R. Agree to that. It might fix things, but not always. The best way to install new packages if you run into those problems is to completely close Positron/R, then restart. Next, immediately install the needed packages with `install.packages('PACKAGENAME')` in the console, without doing anything else. That should minimize any potential conflicts.
- Sometimes when you try to install a package you get the message **`package ‘PACKAGENAME’ is not available for this version of R.`** This is a bit confusing, it sounds like you need to upgrade your R version. What really happens most of the time is that you mis-typed the package name, and that package just doesn't exist (for any version of R). So first make sure you are spelling the package name correctly, including all capitalization being correct. That almost always fixes things. It is rare to find an R package you want that is incompatible with your version of R, unless your R installation is several years out of date.

## R Coding

- **Vectorize.** In R, most things you do can be vectorized.
- What that means is that if you have multiple elements
- For instance if you use the `filter` function from `dplyr`
- If you wanted to do the same in another programming
- That would be multiple lines of code.
- There are other languages that are vectorized like R, so
