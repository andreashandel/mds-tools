# R Coding Tips Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit discusses a few (R) coding tips that are. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Be familiar with some general good coding practices., Be aware of some pitfalls related to R packages., Know a few R coding tips to make your code more efficient and easier to read. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on general coding tips and why it matters. The key ideas here are Here are a few brief suggestions for good coding practices, **Write modular code.** The idea is that you break things, For instance R Markdown chunks are little modules. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on r packages and why it matters. The key ideas here are Sometimes when you install or update a package, you might get the message **`Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?`** What that means is that there is an R package available that has just been updated and exists as *source* but not yet turned into what's called a *binary* format that's pre-compiled for whatever operating system you use. There is almost never a reason to get the very latest *source* version. And if you want to install from source, you might need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to do so. **Therefore, I suggest that when you get this question/message, you check `No`.**, Sometimes during install or updating of a package, you might

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on r coding and why it matters. The key ideas here are **Vectorize.** In R, most things you do can be vectorized., What that means is that if you have multiple elements, For instance if you use the `filter` function from `dplyr`. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
