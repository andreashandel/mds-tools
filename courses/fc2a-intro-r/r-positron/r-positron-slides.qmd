## Overview

- This unit covers the use of R inside of Positron.

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit covers the use of R inside of Positron. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Know how to run R code from within Positron.
- Be familiar with Positron features that help with R coding.

## Writing R Code in Positron

- Once you have your workspace/project open, you can start creating
- Code should be saved in and run from files.
- It is personal choice as to how many and what
- In general, this will be a mix of functions and
- Start a new R file by going to `File` ->
- An empty file should open in the editor area.

```text
# This is a test script
x <- seq(1,100) #create a sequence from 1 to 100 and save as x
y <- x^2 #compute the square of x, assign it to y
plot(x,y) #plot y versus x
```

## Running R Code in Positron

- R gives you two main options for running code.
- One is interactively, line by line.
- That is useful for quick testing and exploring.
- The other option is to fully run scripts.
- This is the preferred way for any real project and
- We suggest you get used to this way of executing

## Debugging R Code in Positron

- As you just saw, if something went wrong running the
- Positron is trying to help you avoid bugs.
- Let's look at a few features.
- Replace one of the round parentheses `(` with a square
- As you do so, you should see the `Problems` tab
- Sometimes these statements are more informative, sometimes less.

## Code formatting

- Positron gives you syntax highlighting, which is very useful for
- For instance it makes it much easier to ensure that
- Another nice feature of Positron is that it comes pre-configured
- In general, whenever you save your file, it will reformat
- If you are an advanced coder and/or have your own
- But it's very useful for novice coders, it really makes

## More features

- There are a lot more features built into Positron that
- If you are an RStudio user, you might likely find
- Positron is still fairly new, so not all features are

## Summary

- We discussed how to use R from within Positron.
- We will pretty much always use R that way.
