Question
========
After restarting R, you run `y <- x^2` before defining `x` and get an error. What does this tell you about running code?

Answerlist
----------
* It will still work because R fills in missing objects automatically
* It only fails when you use `Source R File` instead of the console
* It means the workspace keeps old objects even after a restart
* You need to run code in order; define `x` before using it in `y <- x^2`

Solution
========
Objects have to exist before you use them. After a restart you must recreate `x` (or run the script from the top) before executing `y <- x^2`.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* False
* True
