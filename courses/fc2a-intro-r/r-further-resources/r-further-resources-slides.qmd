In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit gives a few quick pointers to resources that. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
