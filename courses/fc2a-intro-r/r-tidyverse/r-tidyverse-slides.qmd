## Overview

- This unit briefly discusses collections of R packages that are

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit briefly discusses collections of R packages that are. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Be familiar with the `tidyverse` set of R packages.
- Be familiar with the `tidymodels` set of R packages.
- Know about other useful R packages for modeling and data science.

## tidyverse R packages

- Maybe the most widely used collection of R packages is
- The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share
- If you want to learn more about the principles of
- Some of what he writes might not be fully understandable
- For our purpose, the important aspects to remember are that
- They play nice with each other, and help you in

## tidyverse concepts

- As you'll find out shortly, one feature of R code
- The original pipe operator, the `%>%` symbol, was introduced in
- Since then, base R got its own pipe operator, which
- For instance, this is the kind of code that you
- there needs to be something inside the `()`): The idea
- That style of coding makes it often quite easy to

```text
data %>% filter() %>% 
         select() %>%
         fct_lump() %>%
         mutate() %>% ...
```

## tidymodels R packages

- The [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) collection of R packages is very similar in
- Similar to the tidyverse, the packages that make up tidymodels
- The same recommendation applies here as for the tidyverse: Instead

## Other useful R packages

- [`data.table`](https://r-datatable.com/): A package for fast data manipulation and aggregation.
- [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/): A package for building interactive web applications directly from R.
- [`mlr3`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/): A comprehensive framework for machine learning in R.

## Coding style comment

- The `tidyverse` way of writing code is different from base
- The good news is that you can mix and match
- While it's generally a good idea to keep a consistent
- If you use AI to write code, it is often
