# R tidyverse, tidymodels and more Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit briefly discusses collections of R packages that are. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Be familiar with the `tidyverse` set of R packages., Be familiar with the `tidymodels` set of R packages., Know about other useful R packages for modeling and data science. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on tidyverse r packages and why it matters. The key ideas here are Maybe the most widely used collection of R packages is, The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share, If you want to learn more about the principles of. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on tidyverse concepts and why it matters. The key ideas here are As you'll find out shortly, one feature of R code, The original pipe operator, the `%>%` symbol, was introduced in, Since then, base R got its own pipe operator, which. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on tidymodels r packages and why it matters. The key ideas here are The [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/) collection of R packages is very similar in, Similar to the tidyverse, the packages that make up tidymodels, The same recommendation applies here as for the tidyverse: Instead. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 6

In this slide, we focus on other useful r packages and why it matters. The key ideas here are [`data.table`](https://r-datatable.com/): A package for fast data manipulation and aggregation., [`shiny`](https://shiny.posit.co/): A package for building interactive web applications directly from R., [`mlr3`](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/): A comprehensive framework for machine learning in R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 7

In this slide, we focus on coding style comment and why it matters. The key ideas here are The `tidyverse` way of writing code is different from base, The good news is that you can mix and match, While it's generally a good idea to keep a consistent. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 8

In this slide, we focus on summary and why it matters. The key ideas here are In this unit, we briefly discussed the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`, In this unit, we briefly discussed the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`, In this unit, we briefly discussed the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
