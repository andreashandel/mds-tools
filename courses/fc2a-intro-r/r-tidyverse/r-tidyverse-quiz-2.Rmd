Question
========
How does the base pipe `|>` relate to the magrittr pipe `%>%`?

Answerlist
----------
* They are unrelated and can’t be used for the same tasks
* `%>%` works only in Python, while `|>` is for R
* Both pipes pass the left-hand value forward; `|>` is built into base R
* `|>` automatically loads all tidyverse packages

Solution
========
Both pipes forward the left-hand result into the next function; `%>%` comes from magrittr, while `|>` is now available in base R.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* False
