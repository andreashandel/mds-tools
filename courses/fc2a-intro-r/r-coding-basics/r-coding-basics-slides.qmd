## Overview

- This unit covers some very minimal coding in R.

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit covers some very minimal coding in R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Be familiar with basic R coding concepts.
- Be able to write a few lines of R code and run it.

## Learning the basics of R

- Here is a quick crash course on R syntax to
- *Everything is an object.* You create objects with `<-` (assignment)
- *R is vectorized.* Most operations work on whole vectors, not
- *Data frames are tables.* They hold columns of different types.
- Use `$` to access a column.
- Functions take inputs (arguments) and return outputs.

*R is vectorized.* Most operations work on whole vectors, not just
single numbers.

## Some further comments

- R has a bunch of quirks.
- You'll likely encounter a number of them.
- Here are a few common ones.
- A common confusion is that there are two ways of
- One can write `x <- 2` or `x = 2`
- People argue about which way to do it.
