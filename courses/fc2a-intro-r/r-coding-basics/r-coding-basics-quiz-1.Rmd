Question
========
Why is R's vectorization useful when doing basic calculations?

Answerlist
----------
* It only works for text data, not numbers
* It lets you apply operations to entire vectors without writing loops
* It prevents you from using built-in functions like `mean()`
* It forces you to preallocate every object manually

Solution
========
Vectorization allows operations to be applied to full vectors at once (e.g., `scores * 2`), so you avoid writing explicit loops for basic calculations.

Answerlist
----------
* False
* True
* False
* False
