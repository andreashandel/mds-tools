# Basics of Coding in R Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit covers some very minimal coding in R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Be familiar with basic R coding concepts., Be able to write a few lines of R code and run it. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on introduction and why it matters. The key ideas here are This whole course, including this unit, is by no means, The goal is instead to get you started, and give, To really learn R coding, you need to take a. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 4

In this slide, we focus on learning coding and why it matters. The key ideas here are R (or any other programming language) is best learned by, You will learn more R as we go along, but, You will learn by doing as we go through the. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on learning the basics of r and why it matters. The key ideas here are Here is a quick crash course on R syntax to, *Everything is an object.* You create objects with `<-` (assignment), *R is vectorized.* Most operations work on whole vectors, not. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 6

In this slide, we focus on getting help and why it matters. The key ideas here are Maybe the most important skill for learning any programming language, In the past, we recommended starting with Google, StackOverflow, and, At this point, most of the time, you will likely. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 7

In this slide, we focus on some further comments and why it matters. The key ideas here are R has a bunch of quirks., You'll likely encounter a number of them., Here are a few common ones. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 8

In this slide, we focus on summary and why it matters. The key ideas here are We discussed some basics of writing R code., To reiterate, this course is not a learn-to-code course., For resources that can help you learn R coding, see. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
