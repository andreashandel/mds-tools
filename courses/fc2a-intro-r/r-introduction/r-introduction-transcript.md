# Introduction to R Transcript

## Slide 1

In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit provides a high‑level introduction to R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 2

In this slide, we focus on goals and why it matters. The key ideas here are Understand what R is used for., Know some of the strengths and weaknesses of R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 3

In this slide, we focus on programming languages and why it matters. The key ideas here are In brief, programming languages are ways to get a computer, There are many different programming languages, each with its own, Some programming languages are general-purpose, meaning they can be used. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Slide 5

In this slide, we focus on r strengths and weaknesses and why it matters. The key ideas here are R is Open Source, FREE, and cross-platform., R is a "high-level" programming language, relatively easy to learn (compared to Fortran, C, etc.)., R comes with many integrated functions. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.
