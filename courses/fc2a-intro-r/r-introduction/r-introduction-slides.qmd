## Overview

- This unit provides a high‑level introduction to R.

::: {.notes}
In this slide, we focus on overview and why it matters. The key ideas here are This unit provides a high‑level introduction to R. As you study this, think about how these points connect to your own work or projects. If something feels abstract, pause and re-read the unit text for concrete examples, then come back to the slide. The goal is not to memorize every detail, but to build a clear mental map you can use later.

## Goals

- Understand what R is used for.
- Know some of the strengths and weaknesses of R.

## Programming Languages

- In brief, programming languages are ways to get a computer
- There are many different programming languages, each with its own
- Some programming languages are general-purpose, meaning they can be used
- Others are more specialized, designed for specific tasks or domains
- For data-science-type work, there are several popular programming languages, including
- Each of these languages has its own strengths and weaknesses,

## The R language

- R is a programming language and software environment specifically designed
- It was created in the early 1990s by Ross Ihaka
- R has since become one of the most widely used

## R strengths and weaknesses

- R is Open Source, FREE, and cross-platform.
- R is a "high-level" programming language, relatively easy to learn (compared to Fortran, C, etc.).
- R comes with many integrated functions.
- R is great for statistics, data analysis, and graphics.
- The R Community is very dynamic, helpful and welcoming.
- Through R packages, it is easy to get lots of state-of-the-art algorithms.
