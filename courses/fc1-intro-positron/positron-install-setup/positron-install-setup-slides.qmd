::: {.notes}
In this unit, we focus on getting Positron installed and ready to use. The steps are simple, but there are a few details that matter, especially around choosing the right download and granting permissions during setup. I will walk you through the installation flow, what to expect on first launch, and how updates work. Even if you cannot install Positron on your current machine, the concepts still apply and you can use another IDE for the course. The goal is to make sure you can open Positron and see the main interface before the next unit.
:::

## Overview

- Install the correct Positron build
- Complete first-run setup questions
- Verify updates and start cleanly

::: {.notes}
This unit is a quick checklist: download the right installer, step through setup, and confirm updates. If you do this carefully, you avoid issues later. The installation is straightforward, but you should pay attention to platform and architecture. During first launch, Positron may ask for permissions that enable features like networking. Approving those usually makes your experience smoother. Finally, we talk about updates so you know where to check and what to expect. After this unit, you should be ready to open Positron confidently.

## Goals

- Download the correct build for your platform
- Install and launch Positron successfully

::: {.notes}
The goals are practical. First, make sure you pick the right download for your operating system and architecture. Second, run the installer and confirm that Positron launches without errors. Everything else in this unit supports those two goals. If you run into admin restrictions or platform limitations, you can still complete the course using another IDE, but the steps here will help if Positron is available to you.

## Installation

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
- Review the official install page first
- Download the build for your OS and CPU
- Enable recommended install options
- Admin rights may be needed on some systems
- Windows ARM requires a pre-release build (as of Dec 2025)

::: {.notes}
Start by reading the Positron install page so you know the current requirements. Then download the installer that matches your operating system and CPU architecture. During installation, it is usually best to keep the default options, such as file associations, unless you have a reason to change them. On some systems, you might need admin rights, even for a user-level install, so plan for that. Also note that as of December 2025, there is no Windows ARM stable build, so ARM users need a pre-release build. If any of this blocks you, another IDE will still work for this course.

## Setup

- First launch installs bundled extensions
- Approve network and security prompts
- Restart if extensions request it
- Expect panes, menus, and sidebars on success
- Clear notification dots by updating or signing in

::: {.notes}
The first time you open Positron, it sets up built-in extensions. During that process, you may see prompts about network access or security. In most cases, you should allow these so Positron can function fully. If an extension needs a restart, go ahead and restart the app. When setup is complete, you should see the main layout with panes, a top menu, and the left activity bar. If you notice notification dots, they usually indicate updates or a sign-in request, and it is a good idea to resolve those early.

## Updating Positron

- Updates check automatically on launch
- Manual check: `Help` -> `Check for Updates`
- Auto-updates can be disabled if needed
- New install likely has no updates yet

::: {.notes}
Positron checks for updates automatically when you launch it, so in most cases you do not need to do anything. If you want to check manually, open the Help menu and choose Check for Updates. You can also disable automatic updates if you prefer to control when new versions install, though most learners leave it on. Since you just installed Positron, you probably will not have any updates yet. Once you have confirmed the update status, you can close Positron and get ready for the next unit where we explore the interface and extensions.
:::

## Summary

- Install the correct build for your system
- Approve setup prompts for full functionality
- Know where to check updates

::: {.notes}
To summarize, make sure you choose the correct installer, complete the first-run setup, and confirm that Positron opens cleanly. Approving prompts during setup helps ensure features like extensions and networking work without surprises. Updates are mostly automatic, but you now know how to check manually if needed. With installation complete, you are ready to dive into Positron itself and start using it for real work.
