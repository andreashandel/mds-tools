# Configuring Positron Transcript

## Slide 1

In this unit, we focus on customization. Positron is highly configurable, and small adjustments can make your workflow much more comfortable. We will look at settings, themes, and key bindings, and then step back to discuss how far you should go with customization. The goal is to give you the confidence to change what matters most without getting lost in the endless list of options. As you follow along, consider what helps you read and write code clearly and what habits you want to reinforce through shortcuts.

## Slide 2

This unit is about making Positron feel like your workspace. We start with the settings panel, where you can change editor behavior and appearance. Then we explore themes for visual comfort. Finally, we look at key bindings so common actions feel natural to you. These changes are optional, but a few well-chosen tweaks can make a big difference, especially if you will spend a lot of time in the IDE.

## Slide 3

By the end, you should know how to change the most important appearance and behavior settings. You should also understand the difference between user settings, which apply everywhere, and workspace settings, which apply only to the current project. That distinction matters if you want one project to behave differently without changing your global defaults.

## Slide 4

Positron inherits the flexibility of VS Code, which means almost everything can be customized. That is powerful but also easy to overdo. The best approach is to start with a few high-impact settings, such as font size, word wrap, and a theme you like. As you gain experience, you can explore more options. Think of customization as a slow, incremental process rather than a one-time configuration marathon.

## Slide 5

Open the settings panel from the gear icon in the lower left. There are many options, so use the search bar to find what you need. Two common settings to start with are Editor Font Size and Editor Word Wrap. Remember that the tabs at the top let you choose between User settings, which apply everywhere, and Workspace settings, which only affect the current project. If you want a project-specific behavior, switch to the Workspace tab before making changes.

## Slide 6

Themes control the colors and overall look of the editor. You can access them from the gear icon, then Themes and Color Theme. Try a few and pick the one that feels most comfortable for long sessions. Remember, themes only change how the code looks, not the code itself. If you switch between machines or share screenshots, the code will be the same even if the colors look different. Focus on ergonomics and clarity rather than style alone.

## Slide 7

Key bindings let you tailor shortcuts to your habits. Open the Keyboard Shortcuts view from the gear menu. You can search for a command, see its current shortcut, and change it by clicking the pencil icon. For example, Positron uses Ctrl or Cmd plus slash to comment code, while RStudio uses Ctrl or Cmd plus Shift plus C. If you prefer the RStudio shortcut, you can change it. Small adjustments like this make the IDE feel more natural.

## Slide 8

There is a lot more you can customize, from layout behavior to how code runs. The best strategy is to explore as you encounter a need. If you think, I wish Positron did X, there is probably a setting or an extension that helps. Because Positron is based on VS Code, searching for VS Code solutions often works. This keeps you from getting stuck if Positron documentation is sparse. Just remember that incremental changes are easier to evaluate than a huge batch of tweaks.

## Slide 9

To summarize, Positron gives you a lot of control, but you do not need to customize everything. Start with the basics: font size, word wrap, a comfortable theme, and a few shortcuts. Decide whether a change should be global or limited to one project. Over time, you can add more adjustments and extensions as needed. This approach balances personalization with simplicity, which helps you stay productive without getting lost in settings.
