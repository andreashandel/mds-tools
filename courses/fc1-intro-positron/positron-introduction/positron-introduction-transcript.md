# Introduction to IDEs and Positron Transcript

## Slide 1

Welcome to the course and this first unit. In this short deck, we will set the stage for everything that follows. I will explain what an IDE is, why people use them for data analysis and modeling, and where Positron fits in the ecosystem. As we go, you will see how IDEs bring code, files, and output into one place, which makes project work more efficient. You do not need to memorize details yet. Just focus on the big picture and how the pieces connect. That will make the hands-on units easier to follow.

## Slide 2

This unit is a high level introduction. We start with the idea of an IDE, which is more than a text editor. Then we identify the shared parts you see in most IDEs so you can orient yourself quickly. Finally, we explain why Positron is the tool we use in this course. The goal is comfort, not expertise. By the end of the unit, you should be able to describe an IDE, point out the main areas in the interface, and understand why Positron is a good fit for data analysis and Quarto work.

## Slide 3

These goals are straightforward. First, you should be able to define what an integrated development environment is and how it differs from a simple text editor. Second, you should recognize the key components you will see in most IDEs, such as an editor, a console, and sidebars. Third, you should be able to say a few sentences about Positron, including its relationship to RStudio and VS Code, and why we use it for this course. Keep those three points in mind as we move into the reading slides.

## Slide 4

An IDE brings many tasks into one interface. Instead of using separate tools for editing code, running it, managing files, and viewing results, you can do most of that in one place. The editor is the core, but IDEs also add a console or terminal for execution and debugging. Sidebars typically handle files, version control, and outputs like plots. The result is a powerful but sometimes complex environment. The upside is efficiency and fewer context switches. The downside is that it can take time to learn, which is why we start with a clear map of the main parts.

## Slide 5

Positron sits between language specific IDEs like RStudio and general editors like VS Code. It is built by Posit, so it integrates well with R, Python, and Quarto. It is also free and cross-platform. Under the hood, Positron is a variant of VS Code, which means it inherits a mature editor and a large extension ecosystem. On top of that, Positron adds features geared toward data analysis and modeling. This combination gives you a flexible tool that feels familiar if you have used RStudio but is also open to multiple languages and workflows.

## Slide 6

We use Positron because it plays nicely with Quarto and supports the languages most common in data analysis. But the core ideas you learn here are not locked to this tool. If you need to work in VS Code, RStudio, or another IDE, you can apply the same concepts. Positron specific instructions help with exact menu locations or buttons, but the workflows are universal: editing code, running it, managing files, and reading outputs. That flexibility is important, especially if you are using a different setup at work or on a shared machine.

## Slide 7

To wrap up, remember that an IDE is about integration. It brings the tools you need for analysis into one workspace. Positron is our chosen IDE because it is modern, friendly, and closely aligned with Quarto and the Posit ecosystem, while still being built on the robust foundation of VS Code. Most importantly, the workflows you learn will carry over to other tools. In the next units, we move from definitions into practical steps so you can install Positron, explore the interface, and start working with files and code.
