## Introduction

The concepts of projects is very useful for modeling and data analysis work. In Positron, projects are implemented in several flexible ways.


## Projects

The general idea of a project is a collection of files and settings that are used together to accomplish a specific task, such as a modeling and data analysis project. Everything related to that task is stored in one place, namely a folder (with subfolders) on your computer (and probably also in the cloud) making it easier to manage and organize your work. 


## Projects in Positron

If you are familiar with R and RStudio, you know it has the concept of a project through an `.Rproj` file which is stored in some folder. The folder with this file indicates the top level project folder, and everything inside this folder - including sub-folders - is part of the project. 

Positron does support `.Rproj` files. However, since Positron is designed to work with multiple programming languages, it also allows for other types of files to indicate the project folder. A very common setup is where a project corresponds to a Git/GitHub repository (Git/GitHub are explained in our _Brief Introduction to Git/GitHub_ course). In this case, the project folder is the folder that contains the `.git` folder (which is hidden by default). Everything inside this folder - including sub-folders - is part of the project.
