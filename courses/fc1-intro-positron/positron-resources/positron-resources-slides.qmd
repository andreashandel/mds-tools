::: {.notes}
This final unit provides extra resources and a few important reminders. Positron is still evolving, so you will often rely on external documentation and community knowledge. Because it is based on VS Code, most VS Code guidance applies directly. We will also discuss the workspace trust feature, which is a security safeguard you will see when opening folders. Finally, we list useful guides and documentation so you know where to look when questions come up. Use this unit as a reference point when you need help later.

## Overview

- Positron is new and still evolving
- VS Code guidance usually applies
- Know where to find help and docs

::: {.notes}
This unit is about orientation and resources rather than hands-on tasks. Positron is under active development, so its documentation is growing. That means you should lean on the fact that it is built on VS Code and use VS Code resources when Positron-specific answers are missing. We also highlight the trust feature and provide a short list of guides and documentation to help you keep learning.
:::

## Goals

- Identify trusted sources for help
- Understand the workspace trust prompt

::: {.notes}
The goals are simple: know where to look for help and understand what the trust prompt means when you open a project. If you can do those two things, you will be able to troubleshoot and learn independently as you use Positron more.
:::

## Introduction

- Positron documentation is still growing
- Expect small changes over time
- Use resources to fill gaps

::: {.notes}
Positron is relatively new, which means the documentation is not as comprehensive as older tools. You may encounter gaps or small changes in behavior as new versions are released. That is normal. The best strategy is to keep a list of trusted resources and refer to them when you get stuck. In practice, that often means using both Positron and VS Code documentation.

## Positron Equals VS Code (Often)

- Built on the Code OSS foundation
- Most VS Code tips apply directly
- Many VS Code extensions also work
- Expect occasional differences

::: {.notes}
Because Positron is built on the Code OSS base, most VS Code guidance transfers directly. If you cannot find a Positron-specific answer, search for VS Code solutions and try them. Many VS Code extensions also work in Positron, though there are some exceptions. Over time, Positron may diverge more from VS Code, so always test and verify. Still, the VS Code ecosystem is a reliable source of help.

## Trust Issues

- Trust prompts protect against untrusted code
- Trust your own projects; be cautious with unknown sources
- Trust settings can be adjusted in Settings

::: {.notes}
When you open a folder for the first time, Positron may ask whether you trust the files in that workspace. This is a security feature to prevent running untrusted code. If the project is yours or from a source you know, you can usually trust it. If the project is unknown, be cautious and review it first. You can also adjust trust settings in the main settings panel by searching for trust. The prompt might feel inconvenient, but it is there for your safety.

## Tutorials and Other Resources

- Positron Guides are a good starting point
- VS Code Getting Started tutorials are applicable
- VS Code documentation is comprehensive
- Positron migration guide helps RStudio users

::: {.notes}
For continued learning, start with the Positron Guides on the official website. They cover common tasks and workflows. If you need more depth, the VS Code Getting Started tutorials are excellent and generally apply to Positron. The full VS Code documentation is also extensive and useful once you know what you are looking for. If you are coming from RStudio, the Positron migration guide is a focused resource that maps familiar ideas to the new environment.
:::

## Summary

- Positron is new but improving quickly
- VS Code resources fill most gaps
- Use trusted guides to keep learning

::: {.notes}
To close, remember that Positron is evolving, so learning resources are still expanding. The VS Code ecosystem provides a strong foundation of tutorials and documentation that mostly applies. Keep a small set of trusted resources and return to them when questions arise. This approach will help you stay confident and independent as you continue using Positron beyond this course.
