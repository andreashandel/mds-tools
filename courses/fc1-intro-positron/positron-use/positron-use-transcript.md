# Basic Positron Use Transcript

## Slide 1

This unit is a hands-on introduction to using Positron for everyday tasks. We will edit a plain text file, run a small piece of R code, and preview a simple Quarto document. The goal is to show how the editor, console, and viewer work together so you can iterate quickly. If you do not have R or Quarto installed, you can still read along and understand the workflow. The practical steps will make more sense once those tools are available. Treat this as a guided tour of basic actions rather than a deep dive.

## Slide 2

We focus on three basic tasks. First, editing a file in the editor, which is the most common thing you will do. Second, running code directly in Positron so you can see results without switching tools. Third, creating and previewing a Quarto document to see how prose and code combine. These steps are intentionally simple, but they show the core workflow you will use throughout the course: write, run, and review inside one interface.

## Slide 3

There is only one high-level goal here: feel comfortable performing basic actions in Positron. That means opening a file, editing it, saving it, running a small script, and previewing a document. These skills are the foundation for everything else. As long as you can do these steps, you can build toward more complex workflows later.

## Slide 4

At the core of Positron is the editor. It is where you write text, code, and documents. The advantage of an IDE is that you can also execute code directly from the same window, which reduces friction. In this unit, we keep the examples small so you can focus on the workflow. You will see how a simple file becomes a running script and how output appears right next to your code. This is the loop you will use constantly: edit, run, inspect, repeat.

## Slide 5

The most basic use of Positron is editing text. You can create a new file or open an existing one and make changes. Even a CSV can be edited as text if you want to tweak values. Positron will often help you with syntax highlighting, which makes it easier to read and reduces mistakes. When you practice, try saving under a new name to keep the original file intact. This simple workflow prepares you for more complex tasks because everything else in Positron builds on file editing.

## Slide 6

To see code execution, create a new R file and type a few lines like the example. Save the file, then run it using the small triangle button or by sending lines with Ctrl or Cmd plus Enter. The console will show output and errors, and the viewer will display the plot. If you need to check a function, you can type `?plot` in the console to open help. After the first run, try changing the plot type and run again. This shows how the editor and console work together for fast iteration.

## Slide 7

Next, try a basic Quarto document. Create a new Quarto document from the File menu. Add a title, a heading, and a few lines of text. Then insert a short code chunk like the example. Save the file as a `.qmd` and click preview. Quarto will render the document and show the output in the viewer pane or an external browser, depending on your settings. This is the core Quarto workflow: mix narrative and code, then render to a clean output. If you do not have Quarto installed yet, read along so the steps will feel familiar later.

## Slide 8

To wrap up, you saw how Positron handles basic editing, code execution, and Quarto preview. The key idea is integration: you do not need to jump between multiple tools. You can write, run, and view results in one place. Even a tiny example gives you the full loop of editing, executing, and inspecting. That loop is what makes IDEs powerful for data analysis. In the next units, we will build on these basics and show how projects and extensions make workflows more scalable.
