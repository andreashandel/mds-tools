# Basic Positron Features Transcript

## Slide 1

This unit is your guided tour of the Positron interface. We will break the IDE into its main areas so you can build a mental map. The goal is not to memorize every menu command, but to understand where to look when you need a file, a console, or a plot. Each slide focuses on one pane or feature. As you follow along, keep Positron open if you can and click the same areas. That hands-on link between the interface and the description will help the layout feel familiar very quickly.

## Slide 2

We are going to cover the layout and the most visible features of Positron. You will learn where the editor sits, where the console and terminal live, and where plots and variables appear. This will give you a consistent frame of reference for later units when we start running code and working with documents. As you go, try to connect each label to the actual interface. You do not need to explore every icon today. The key is to recognize the structure and remember that it is flexible and can be rearranged later.

## Slide 3

By the end of this unit, you should be comfortable naming the main panes and knowing their purpose. You should be able to explain where you write code, where you run it, where outputs appear, and where you manage files. This is the foundation for efficient work later. Once you can orient yourself, the rest of the IDE becomes less intimidating. Think of this as your map before you start any journey.

## Slide 4

Positron is designed around the idea that you do several types of work in a single project: editing files, running code, and viewing results. The interface reflects that by splitting into panes. The activity bar on the left switches between views, the editor is the main writing surface, panels below run code and commands, and the right side shows output like plots or variables. The layout can be adjusted, but the basic structure is consistent. This slide gives you the big picture so that the detailed slides make sense.

## Slide 5

The top menu bar looks like most applications and contains the full set of commands. The left vertical icon bar is the Activity Bar, which switches the main view in the Primary Side Bar. The first icon opens the File Explorer, which you will use all the time for navigation, and the search icon helps you find text across files. Other icons relate to Git, extensions, or language tools. You do not need to learn every icon now. Just remember that the Activity Bar controls what appears in the side panel next to it.

## Slide 6

The editor is the central workspace. This is where you write code, edit documents, and view text-based files. It provides helpful features like syntax highlighting, linting, and auto-completion, which make writing faster and less error-prone. You can open many files at once, with tabs across the top to switch between them. The editor is flexible and works well for Quarto documents, scripts, Markdown, and even data files like CSVs. When you think of Positron as an IDE, the editor is the core.

## Slide 7

Below the editor, you will find the panel area. The Console runs your active language, such as R or Python, and it is where you see output and errors when you execute code. The Terminal is separate and behaves like a normal system shell, which is useful for tools like Quarto or Git. Other tabs in this area can show diagnostics or background processes. The important distinction is that the console is language-specific, while the terminal is for system-level commands.

## Slide 8

The viewer pane, usually at the bottom right, is where visual outputs appear. If you create a plot in R or Python, it shows up here automatically. Interactive outputs like HTML widgets or data table previews also appear in this space. If you use Quarto with internal preview, the rendered document will show here as well. This makes it easy to iterate because you can write code in the editor and immediately see the visual result without leaving the IDE.

## Slide 9

The top right pane typically shows the environment, which is a list of objects that exist in your current session. For example, if you create a data frame or a vector, it will appear here. You can click objects to inspect them, which helps you understand what your code produced. Some setups also show command history or other information in this area. This pane is especially useful when you are exploring data interactively or debugging a script.

## Slide 10

At the top center of the window is a small box that looks like search. Clicking it reveals the command palette, which is one of the fastest ways to use Positron. Instead of navigating menus, you can type a few letters and run commands directly. This is especially powerful for things like Quarto actions, formatting, or changing layouts. The same box can also be used for normal search. Over time, you may find this is your favorite way to access features quickly.

## Slide 11

Even though we have covered the main panes, Positron has many more features. Some appear only when you run certain tools or open particular files. This is normal in complex software. The key is to explore gradually and build confidence with the essentials first. As you continue using Positron, you will discover additional panels, commands, and shortcuts that fit your workflow. Think of this unit as the foundation. The deeper features will become clear as you use the IDE in real work.

## Slide 12

To summarize, Positron is built around a set of panes that each serve a specific purpose. The editor is where you write, the console and terminal are where you run things, and the sidebars help with files, outputs, and environments. The layout is flexible, so you can adjust it later to match your preferences. For now, the most important outcome is that you can orient yourself quickly. With that in place, the next units will feel much easier because you will know where everything lives.
