## What is Python

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is widely used in data analysis, automation, and software development. It is designed to be readable and approachable.

## Why Python for data work

Python has a large ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. It is often chosen for projects that combine data analysis with software engineering.

## Strengths and tradeoffs

Python is easy to read and has a huge library ecosystem. The tradeoff is that pure Python code can be slower than compiled languages, so performance-critical work often relies on optimized libraries.

## Python in this course

We will use Python as a practical tool for data tasks. The focus is on doing real work rather than learning every language feature.
