# Purpose

This website is a small stand-alone site with short courses covering different tools for modeling and data science. The focus is on tools that we use for our teaching and research.



# Authors

This website is currently run by [Andreas](https://www.andreashandel.com/) and [Brian](https://brianmckay.netlify.app). We are two academic scientists, researchers and teachers. 


<!-- We are both fairy opinionated when it comes to the right way of doing analyses. Thus, the advice you'll find on this site represents our views. We believe they are reasonable and we hope what we present is useful to you. -->
